everybody and ice camera action a DND

game of action and adventure where

people cry mostly in the chat well we

have fun playing this wonderful game we

call Dungeons and Dragons

so I your DM I'm going to just recap

very briefly what has happened in the

campaign thus far that may or may not be

relevant to tonight's game so shortly

after arriving in port lions are ooh in

to stop the death curse deaath cut a

deal with a man named lyric - 'land

trading a ship for a detailed map of

cult leading to three locations omou or

illunga and Nangal or of which the

waffle crew eventually visited two of

them in the course of making their way

to omou they found a crashed hal ruined

sky ship and in its wrecked cargo hold a

explosive device shaped like a black

iron egg which at one point later on

went nearly went off before DF disarmed

it by jamming one of his keys into its

key hole and that key has been stuck in

the egg ever since and they've been

hauling it around with them upon their

return upon their return to port lions

are ooh they had to raise evylyn and

Simon from the dead and so DF and paltin

went into the city to procure two

diamonds which they did acquire and

delivered them to omen drawn the CEO of

acquisitions incorporated and a cleric

of Tamura of great repute big and Roman

he's fine Roman used the diamonds in the

ritual to raise both evil and end Simon

from the dead whereupon evil and

expressed confusion over a great many

things that had happened during her

absence he also stole the Rings and yes

after which he had been given the Rings

that contained fragments of evil in SOL

rings given to DF and

the first time evylyn died and basically

walked out the door at those rings

before anybody realized they were gone

which I am very upset about the safe

house that the party was staying at was

compromised when DF and paltin found an

iron token on the doorstep of the place

as they were returning with the diamonds

not really understanding the

significance of that but it might be

tied to a later poisoning attempt

someone basically put poison in some

cookies that Strix made in the kitchen

Awful's ate most the cookies she doesn't

see many of the worse for wear but it's

clear that they were tainted by someone

or something which prompted then the

waffle crew to vacate the premises

before they were set upon again by said

assassins DF you rendezvous with lyric -

'land mm-hm and presented your map to

him whereupon you recalled quite

suddenly and horrific aliy that it's

only two-thirds of what you promised to

do some some amount of time passes not a

lot of time you're standing down by the

harbor on the wharf looking out towards

the pier at a sloop a ship with one sail

called the brazen pegasus and lyrica

standing beside you and he says while

the map won't pay for a whole ship it

will at least book you passage on one of

the swiftest ships I can make

arrangements with captain automate to

see you delivered North is everyone okay

with this

evylyn is laying on the deck her head

and arms hanging over it splashing in

the water you guys do you think do you

think she came back with half her brain

yeah Larrick gives you a sort of a

sidelong Claire DF just like unspoken

asking the question is your friend okay

[Laughter]

dear Sirs Kagome won't like a look I've

just kind of like yeah it's just how she

is

okay miss tricks just like that looks

usually meant for me

we don't need extravagant voyages back

home in fact something Swift may also be

probably better for us so I apologize

for not truly upholding the entirety of

our deal and only getting part on the

map but we would be absolutely gracious

for any passage way home we could just

go back to an angle or don't need to go

to water Dean come please no we haven't

even finished the drunken dying tour we

only did our first performance real

quick evylyn we're do you know what

direction Bangalore is we'll be taking

that bow now all right introductions

quickly follow as you are led down the

wharf down the pier and when you come

upon the ship you can see standing on

the pier next to it is a female gnome

with a tricorn hat that makes her look

taller her extra high boots also help

she's probably now a good three and a

half feet tall mm-hmm and she's standing

there talking to some dock workers

paying them some coin and shouting

occasionally to what you assumed to be

her first mate a grizzled pale skinned

human with a long salt-and-pepper beard

and all you can see the other

crewmembers on the ship you've seen

maybe like three or four of them and

they're there busily working and doing

odd chores one of them seems to be

mopping the deck you see some water

cascade off the edge of the of the deck

as the mop swings around but yes she

stops what she's doing comes over to you

stands by lair

side and holds a hand and a gesture of

friendship up toward you lovely oh good

day good day welcome

yep I'll take the hand and shake it what

was the name again

my name is captain autumn a swift and

dark very ship the brazen Pegasus

welcome apart looks fast

are you paying says she says to lyric

and lyric and nods and they paid for a

smooth fast ride he tells her we can

outrun any pirate ship in the high seas

tricks is already looking for ropes to

tie everyone to she's like well based on

the looks at you I don't think pirates

are gonna be much of a problem just like

oh my god you talk so oh ok yes she

smells like lilacs yep and just a little

trace of some sort of scented oil yeah

there's always the smell of Strix in the

background is that your yar it smells

real familiar she says you can uh I'd be

happy to share anything he'll be like oh

my I gave a couple of extra cases on

board but she's also distracted by how

the wind feels on her face so she kind

of wanders that way Larrick says the map

all long since rolled up in his coat I

will leave you two get acquainted then

it's been a pleasure doing business with

you and safe travels back home they keep

everything Marik and he wanders off and

she says so much your luggage oh my back

probably this is pretty much it we

travel light can I point out waffles but

there it is

oh yeah oh yeah we travel light aside

from the bear the giant behemoth she

sort of looks worriedly at this and she

says do you have food for said beasts

strix oh can i go grab some yeah there's

nothing stopping you from going into the

market if you have quality I spend I

know I do I look at pulse and I'm like

I'll throw her like what what do you

what do you need what do you want I'm

gonna be buying a lot of dinosaur meat

and probably salts a dinosaur mate and

maybe some some you know I don't know I

hear do you get scurvy on boats I'm also

gonna get some lemons lemons great I

really don't want scurvy so okay I'll

like flicker a gold 20/20 oh wow need an

event sorry like take sad news here like

it jingles off and she's like alright so

I'll pick up however much salted meat

and a couple of lemons I think I need

for waffles and I'll also buy Paulson

some wine yeah just in general ask the

captain any additional supplies that are

needed before we head out we could make

sure we acquire them well you're you

were to explore essential yes uh yeah we

were ready have to explorers came back

with lots of treasure we did it well

he's a treasure of adventure the real

treasure was the raises an eyebrow the

way the buns that were made no they

can't put a price on that can you now no

no I can't um and so strict says you go

off I'm getting meals and whatnot and

wine do you want to get like common wine

or fine wine

oh I'm gonna get common eye that paltin

can tell okay you can get an enormous

supply of food and also the merchants

will cover the expense and of actually

sending workers down with the supplies

to the ships you don't have to carry it

all oh that's good that helps I was just

gonna tie it all the waffles but okay

well you could do that too I just like

imagining her coming back with just like

a giant like a bunch of like backpack of

supplies on her berry go that'll work

just fine and then you don't have to tip

them not that you would anyway but I dip

them in snacks and I don't think they'd

want those she says did Larry forget to

tell you about the tribute you have to

pay to Aramaic the dragon turtle to get

out of the bay of chopped alive I'm

sorry I'm not slow down

the dragon turtle the dragon turtle that

we have to pay tribute to you yeah did

you understand everything what you

understand everything she's saying yeah

great what she said did we know about

the tribute that we have to pay to the

dragon turtle who guards the the bay no

well I did not know this I guess now we

do what is the tribute well it's not a

fixed amount per se it's more like you

pay what you can and it accepts what it

will take and if it doesn't think it's

enough it will sink your ship Oh

it'll sink our ship if we don't please

it I have been told I have a for old

smile so we're gonna throw that into the

beta was this a tribute that you were

anticipating us uncovering or is this

something that you normally have at the

ready or typically if we carry

passengers they provide the tribute for

themselves yes list examples that have

worked preferably big chests of gold

always nice

okay well as big as me yeah we don't

have that much gold you have any other

ideas um the dragon like big things and

shiny things and magic things big shiny

magic okay um well the albear is our

biggest thing we're definitely not using

shiny things shiny do have lots of shiny

things evil and you've got one

you're so right hold on she like dives

into a package like trying to uncover

something and she she has about that

bomb Holmes also like shuffling through

his stuff he's like hidden he like for a

second like looks at evens range like

that's probably a bad idea

literally just a pile of pretty things

that she has and in that is the four

blocks of incense and sensor and the

semi-precious stones from the mask I

believe from the yak folk

town and a whole bunch of bead jewelry

it's just like a pile of all of those

pretty things that she collected yeah it

looked it looked bigger in your backpack

points to the piles like how about that

and a nice song ooh

music that's even more valuable I never

know that I can turtle to take a song

before but you never know there could be

a first time I think we should Bank

everything on Paulson being able to play

a nice song oh boy why don't you make

yourselves comfortable on board with

your treasure in your song and one of my

crews ready to go whenever you Murr okay

I don't think there's any being in the

entire world who would not be pleased by

a song that Paulson played maybe we

should look around for more stuff said

the dragon turtle eats the treasure

right well the dragon turtle sometimes

swallows the Treasury but I assume that

regurgitate sit somewhere else

Oh oh good why don't we give it the bomb

does it like explosives not that we're

bringing any on to this you can see

she's trying to parse what you're saying

and try to get at what you're talking

about

hypothetically and she says I don't know

probably not I don't that's worth a lot

I think I don't know and I know we'll

deal with it

oh wait what about Pelton what about

that disc thingy you found is that weird

if anything all right

sacred disk yes take out the whatever

that thing was that coin disk thing

thing yeah hahaha when you show that to

her you see her face Blanche

oh oh oh oh oh I'm not sure this is

gonna work out I am immediately going to

cast suggestion on I'm sorry no I'm

gonna go for persuasion I'm gonna be

like okay so you find this to be an

authentic replica

let's go with deception okay instead of

persuasion okay go ahead

ooh that is good that is a 26 oh my god

you see that you you sort of talk about

it in that terms and she just sort of

goes oh so it's not a really a typical

society token then that's great

absolutely

because we would never think to bring

one of those on board what are they sure

you've heard about the attempt to

society the secret society of port Lions

are who basically makes sure that all

troublemakers are dealt with in a

speedily an exhibition fashion I don't

know left on steps outside of a house

where people were staying that might be

some sort of indication that maybe they

were troublemakers exactly that's a sign

into trouble with the city somehow and

that they're gonna take their vengeance

upon you if you don't rectify the

situation promptly understood and I'm

Paul moon's gonna like immediately a

point behind her it's like that part on

the ship that particular thing what is

that just trying to get her to turn

around I'm just gonna that like the sail

like hmm or maybe you were applied to

get the mast oh I could have been you're

so you're very boat smart I think what

this calls for is a final retirement

performance of the drunk and dying tour

and we should have just like a floating

dock and we'll put Paulson on there and

then we can do some like you know

fireworks and things like illusions and

we can just have a big concert and the

turtle will be so excited and everyone

will love it and we'll be heroes and if

anyone thought we were causing any

trouble actually we're just great

upstanding contributing our artist

citizens and then we can just leave the

dragon turtle doesn't come into the

harbor usually well we can do the

floating dock wherever it mostly stays

out in the bay mostly okay in the best

but weird question is there a way around

it she's bragging she points it she

points out past the harbor past the

statue of nan Naboo so the old Sheldon

King that sort of stands in the middle

of the harbor out past the lighthouse

toward the bay which is huge wide open

blue watered bay

but the mountains do sort of close

around it almost like a claw so

eventually you have to sort of leave by

a straight and she points you out toward

that straight and says that that's

typically where the dragon turtle waits

for ships as they come and go makes them

easy to spot and they have no

maneuverability right so there's not a

whole lot of choice right in going

through that and that's that's so far

out you can just barely see it through

the haze so even the people of Port and

ions are who never really see the

Dragons surface in the Strait or deal

with the ships at all like yes gray yeah

but she like kind of hustles you guys

like into it like a circle away from the

gnome and like keeps looking at the

gnome like she's like look we throw the

bomb in if we take the key out it's on

the dragon has a bigger problem than we

have and we leave I could be mistaken

because math is not my strongest but I'm

pretty sure at that range we would get

blown to smithereens as well we're this

fast ship right I don't know how to do

that this looks like the train going in

like one direction what time do we all

die or hear me out what if we actually

solved this business before we leave

whatever this issue is whatever society

is against us clearly is some kind of

mistake or something maybe what society

what are you talking about there's no

point I think maybe he has a valid point

because we should not leave Scheldt at

all and definitely not go to water deep

I think that sounds nice well it could

be safer for us and I just removed for

once we don't run

I'm down what we're talking about the

people who what was it

poisoned food right

those yep and you're like maybe they

wanna maybe they just want to talk could

be bees all one big mistake look

literally fought clones of ourselves

they probably just thought was them the

whole time as soon as you say don't run

Strix is just like on the ground going

[Applause]

like now I can tell you that the evil

twin story rarely works and by rarely I

mean never I don't need to here by your

fast break ups eric says you're sitting

there wallowing on the dock captain or

to make um ZUP behind you just sort of

taps you exactly on the shoulder and

says we have time before we go for you

to take a bath even raises her hand

immediately me me oh man

their bath houses in the city never a

cheap the money goes to the attorney

money goes to the temples Alton is still

floored by that snap by the way like I'm

mister protag I'll follow your lead

[Laughter]

mister what really sad that the gnome

children take a bath just like we got

the bath like and she asked the no she's

like do they have like really nice warm

water

they sure do perfume scented waters oh

yeah I really want to go there

captain when will you be ready to depart

we won't leave until you're ready we'll

be ready very soon

yeah I don't think that's enough time

for the bathhouse episode guys sorry

Alton says we're not in any hurry we

wait for you I promise I won't have an

episode I just want to go to the

bathhouse episode we mean psychotic

episode because I'm already there

maybe I mean or we could enter another

dinosaur race or oh yeah that's good

let's bring attention to ourselves huh I

I hate this place and I would like to

leave but if we have problem to fix then

I'm happy to stay because I'm not going

to run away and she's just like I'm just

I'm just saying like instead of how many

more problems have always come back to

find us later because we tried to ignore

it or run away from it maybe just once

we could just I don't know I thought

maybe for once we could actually solve

everything here and not run from our

problems even know how to get in touch

with these people I don't think we get

in touch with them you know I kind of I

kind of see I kind of see your point and

that might that might be a good idea um

before I agree to that I'm gonna turn to

turn now and be like do you have like a

guesstimate on when we would be leaving

we'll stay here as long as we have to

before are you ready to go well if we

were to like just want to go would you

say it'd be like less than an hour yeah

okay so we need to run we can still run

paltin casts invisibility on himself mhm

and goes all right cool yeah whatever

you guys want to do I'm already dude how

about this can I just use like I don't

know minor illusion or no what is it

press it did

yeah just make some words in the air

that says we're sorry it's HAP pesticide

you wouldn't be able to do them very far

away or particularly you know high up

it's not like skywriting right could we

just walk around with that yeah I'm sure

the secret society won't have any

objection do you around big signs with

their name on it as he was like like

flush it away she's just like I tried

maybe they'll try and kill us in the

bathhouse yeah I think we're having that

problem again where we all just like

don't make a decision for a really long

time so I think you should make it ah



all right how about this resolves one

hour we'll give ourselves one hour

evylyn you can go to the bathhouse I'll

try to gather a rubber information I can

and see if I can't write a note or

something I try to explain things or get

things sorted because I think talking to

the right people could help a lot like

we apprehended their right evil doors

that way with and then exactly one hour

from now we all meet back up here and

regardless of how anything else is going

we leave I want I want to try please

don't make me go to the bathhouse

[Laughter]

nepal's like please don't make me go the

bathhouse please if you you so you

really want to talk to these people you

really want to clear our names huh I

just think I just think they're not that

mean yeah we do anything wrong

life just being maybe if we just

explained that and this is okay first of

all because we're I'm assuming that

they're mad at us for what our what

their what the what the other crew did

yeah all right that's what I'm imagining

so what if we could prove it wasn't us

because one of them out there somewhere

so what if we could bring him back and

be like look it wasn't us and they'll

leave us alone he knew it was nice

they're not the ones the guards are mad

at us it was someone else it was the

secret people and we don't know why they

were mad at us they can be mad at us

because we survived we don't know why

they're mad at us that's why explaining

it might be a bad idea because what if

they're like all we wanted them to die

well let's get them now with those

poisons and the cookies it's tricks work

so hard on its tricks are you ok no ok

so so we don't think that it's from the

twin twinsies

I mean it might be but at least the law

here saw that it was not well actually I

don't know I was dead we might just want

to leave we can try for an hour we could

maybe try and figure out why they want

us but I we don't know if they're good

or evil or the only thing that captain

or tomato lose babbling on was that the

attempt cos society is a port Lions our

organization that protects port and I

and Xaro against what they what it

perceives to be threats to the city's

well-being right so all the do is ask

around trying a little more information

and then we can decide from there

alright well time's a-wastin and if

we're gonna do that I wanna have time

for a bath before we leave so let's go

alright

at least we can least try to learn a

little bit make sure we be making the

right decision in the first place

alright lead the way DF okay captain or

debate which way was the bath house for

Elin she will set you on the course in

fact she's got a couple crewmembers are

gonna rush into town to pick up a few

things for her and they will basically

just lead you to where you need to go

oh they are evylyn Dillo company you

wait we're not all going together no I

gotta figure out this whole thing well

what better place to ask around than a

bathhouse

you're gonna has a point these two

crewmen who you're traveling with

actually crew crew on the crewmen they

tell you that the bath houses here are

run by the priesthood of soon the god of

beauty they're generally beautiful

marble floored tiled bath houses you

leave a donation there and then please

stay in the bath house as long as you

like and they will help clean you they

have masseurs and masseuses and they do

they can they fix this table set they

can absolutely pretty you up they can

also have people come by with diaphanous

silk clothing for you to buy while you

are relaxing in the pool you know sounds

like a lot of things I don't need and

it's a place to where people everyone of

every walk of life can sort of rub

shoulders with higher and lower echelons

everybody's kind of equal and in these

places all right yeah we'll go with you

we'll go to the bathhouse not in it you

don't have to take a bath no one's

making you take a bath it's okay well at

least go with third so we can stay close

and then around that area I'll try to

gather whether any information that

possibly could

who knows they might have a mud pit

maybe you can get dirtier I don't know

right there you go may and I'm sure they

have you know garbage too if you just

want to like hang out they mad if that's

your thing

I don't know Alton you know me too well

I try all right so you do arrive at one

of these bath houses it's got a great

arch entrance with

plants on the outside and priests of

soon standing in the doorway fun and so

just try to drop me off sorry I came

back to life I'm just gonna go so you

walk in and they're screaming behind you

[Laughter]

one of the priests very demurely asks if

she can take your hat and destroy it

maybe give you something new evil and

you find yourself sort of swept through

this place by expert handlers who ask

you what you'd like to do if you have

any preferences for certain bathing oils

or temperature or all that businesslike

excellent as much as you can and like in

between when they leave her alone to

like you know

soak her feet or whatever she gets all

pouty but when she's when they're

talking to her she's like oh yes the

newest this and that and style and

fashion blah blah yeah and how's just a

grand old time

excellent what are the rest of you doing

so while she's doing that so this

detective society is some kind of

underground secret of nyan Zaru so it

would seem okay I would like to you to

try to use my more more natural ability

at gathering information about seedy

underground to the much much as best I

possibly can to learn whatever I can

about them using like thieves can't yes

and I'm sorry I was hoping this would be

I talked to the right people and using

my lingo to yeah I don't know get that

trust and discuss it or even I got the

background feature city

so I would like to I think feel like I

also used that to kind of get a feel

yes about this information just

basically try to figure out the topic of

society what their mo is what are they

definitely good or evil or they like you

know drop the ass axe ask questions

later kind of society yeah as much as I

came I want to be clear I am also doing

the exact same thing but instead of

thieves can't I'm using stylists can't

[Laughter]

it's one of the most effective

information and gathering techniques it

is yeah absolutely

actually stylist can Strix is just gonna

stand a good ten feet like behind DF as

he's doing all this stuff just like

totally useless and palton you're just

staying invisible and the general

vicinity as well

yep just listening in on what is told to

be s okay visibly yes just make a

charisma persuasion check with advantage

and evil and do the same yeah I wrote to

nineteen oh my god an effort bonus at

the total 25 oh we got an excellent with

advantage you said oh wow it barely

matters those are horrible roles I'm

starting to hate these guys

um Oh luckily I have plus 9/2 persuasion

so sixteen okay

so evil in in your chit chat you you

find out that the attempt cos society is

known to the priesthood so many of the

people that you're talking to actually

are quite aware of it they know they

don't know how many members there are in

the city but the priesthood believes

it's pretty small but the members are

primarily good-hearted Shelton's who

in many respects share goals similar

with those of the Harper's of the north

that is to say that they oppose any

individual or group that would abuse

power for to the detriment of society

and you also find out from them that

this attempt of society was instrumental

in liberating Portman's ro from foreign

powers and facilitating the rise of the

seven merchant princes after those

powers were driven out do I hear any

gossip about our group in particular why

we might be personas not they've heard

nothing about your group in particular

when they tell you that when the society

judges that someone has damaged the

social fabric of port millions are or

child or is on the verge of committing a

great wrong they will often present a

warning in the form of an iron token

with the Triceratops head and it's up to

the marked individual or individuals to

figure out the meaning of the token and

take steps to correct the offending

behavior or to undo the damage if damage

has been done D actually learn all of

this information and in addition you

also learn that the society has of late

been working tirelessly to prevent the

centaurum and other dubious factions

from taking over the government or

gaining undue influence moreover they've

been taking steps to covertly eliminate

the threat from pirates which is

becoming an increasing problem in the

area and you hear through the can't that

there are probably fewer than 50 members

of the attempt cos Society and they

don't advertise their membership but

identify one another using a simple hand

gesture which is a raised left hand with

the index finger the middle finger and

the third finger extended representing

the three horns of the unicorn or at

nothing--as corn Triceratops okay okay

the Triceratops cook-off yeah so

because of their secretiveness not many

people understand or like they have no

idea where they're based or whatever and

you can be walking down the street and

any of any of the faces you look at

could be somebody who belongs to the

otaku society okay so what I got from

this was we got a warning or same symbol

of source to say that they believe we

did something wrong and all we need to

do is correct it yep

what did we do I don't know but they

also say we could try to interpret it

figure it out based on the disk that

Regatta got from them

halten risk the disk yeah remember we

found on the steps a little thing you

had the Triceratops on it it turns out

that's actually a warning or symbol of

the Utopia Society but I mean we need it

though do we maybe we don't necessarily

need it but I feel like it could be

helpful damn good you could find someone

that could deliver a letter to them

maybe we could write a letter to them a

nice apology letter yeah I mean that was

my thought to thought about that huh and

strict's will turn her staff and do the

coil plan to be like I'm ready all right

keep that at the ready as soon as we can

find someone there maybe can actually

get to them I could say sorry a lot yeah

well this is going on evil then you sort

of transfer yourself to a private bath

this sort of big pool with all these

marble pillars surrounding it and you're

just sort of maybe sitting on a pool

step or whatever the water is scented

and beautifully smelling and you might

have little cucumbers on your eyes I

don't know well yeah I think I also take

some time to write a letter to my pen

pal omen well in there you oh so you're

gonna like break out our writing kit or

something in December they have some

there right they have like a little

piece of paper and clothing I can rent

right he does have a big church

yeah sure cool yep

so in that case they'll probably after

after you've taken your bath and you're

just sort of wearing one of the

priesthood house coats they'll just put

you in a small chamber where you can

write out your letter and there's some

natural I can't do it in the pool sure

come for that yeah worried they tell you

not to get any ink in the pool oh I'll

be very careful okay so you're just

writing the letter by the side of the

pool yeah but you've pretty much got to

your cell number on my I just like yeah

okay make a perception check Wow your

one eye yeah it's horrible like six okay

okay you perceive nothing hang on as

always

so pölten does not produce the token DF

okay

I'm sure it's fine this is fine yeah we

I think if we need it then we we can

yeah I mean of course you know it's it's

around I hid it tactfully well cuz I

knew but I didn't want it on my person

you've had it longer than I did do you

remember anything else about it aside

from the fact that I had a triceratops

on it do I was there like a post-it note

that just said something like no there

was nothing

I'll just the just the Triceratops and

it was a heavy relic same rights the

letters sorry we lost your token so we

don't know what you did wrong we did

wrong whoops process it's not lost it's

misplaced if you see we can go find it

again though right yeah do something

flashes across your eyes like the

slightest like somebody's shining a

light in your eyes and when you look up

on its source

there's somebody up on a

rooftop a flat roof top looking down in

the general area where the three of you

are and you can see that the sunlight is

gleaming off of a staff that this figure

is holding it's also gleaming off of the

figure itself which appears to be

humanoid wearing a white and blue robe

quite exquisite with like gold fittings

and things which also gleam in the Sun

okay so and then when it's clear that

this figure has gotten your attention

you see it withdraw out of sight right

away nothing about it suggests to me

that it's possibly in tea room you can't

really get a great look at it because

you had the light in your eyes it was a

kid it was a humanoid in a light colored

robe a white man okay do I notice that

death is distracted you would have seen

the light sort of flash across his eyes

and then he sort of looked up at the

source of it for an instant there what I

miss I think someone just signaled me

and find out who that was he's over that

way that way yes that way dude come with

us was he like on our roof or something

or yes

okay let me well let's figure figure out

what that's all about and I'm gonna just

dimension door up there perfect yes

there seinem there's sort of a magical

door effect that appears but yours I

guess your invisibility would end

because it's concentrations so you

appear as you are on the roof and you

are standing in the presence of a

humanoid who looks like a cross between

a man and a gold dragon his head is that

of a gold dragon

he has golden claws or golden hands with

black talons and he looks like a half

dragon man in a robe carrying a staff

with a green orb at the top

so after paltin dimension doors up there

d it'll turn districts and just tell her

to get up there and back them up I'll

catch up okay I'll use my broom

so those two G's are cool magic powers

and fly up and tell everyone I mentioned

are you up to Oh or whatever you want

evil and you don't have to evylyn as you

are writing somebody Garrett's you from

behind oh yeah not cool and they must

have come up out of the water so

everybody roll initiative there on the

whole time I didn't get to say anything

you may yet

if you roll hi we'll start with Evelyn I

roll in that one oh my god yeah I roll

in at 20 so 25 total holy balanced Strix

I got an 1818 palton you know when you

said if you roll high I'm like you know

what that probably will result in an at

one which it did but you're like plus

something right

so whopping three three great so a DF

you see paltin banff appear up on the

roof and he is visible how far away did

he go

oh he probably went about 50 feet oh

that's nothing across about plus about

30 feet up

oh that's prom for old cunning action -

mm-hmm get out - that fast hands and

start climbing up onto that roof yeah

there are awnings and four to Burns's

that you can basically leap from one to

the other to kind of make your way up

there but I will ask you to make an

athletics check athletics yep but what

if I said I was doing board flips that's

great athletics to me that's needed

clear forward flips oh okay oh just a

flat 15 great yeah so you are able to

hop on up there and see this figure who

kind of

seems a little bit threatened by the

suddenness of Putin's appearance and has

turned his staff pointedly at your bard

yeah yeah say you wanna do anything else

that's alright that's a make it up there

I feel like I got uh I got your signal

we're just here to talk okay I do this

maybe make this make a persuasion check

Raptor claws persuasion sixteenth that

seemed your word either your words the

sign or some combination of tunes seemed

to sort of stay his whatever action he

was planning and he sort of lowers his

staff oh thank god boom and says you

have been asking questions yeah yeah and

you get the answers that you seek not

quite the ones that were open for know

he says I can't tell you much but I will

tell you this you are not the recipient

of that token I was gonna also think

that but we are so guilt-ridden I

assumed it was for us he says in a way

it was of course it was prospering

realized we have come to realize that

there are others who look remarkably

like you yeah that's exactly it we know

exactly what you're talking about they

are the token was given to them they

must have passed it on to you those

clever bastards that clever bastard well

then if you know this token perhaps it

would calm you to know that we have

taken care of almost all

of the recipients the threats the

threats tonight enviro we have dealt

with it he says the token has caused

enough trouble return it to me yes

let's return it right on it dimension

way are we still an initiative yeah

actually

so that will take us to Strix I'll uh

fly up there with your beer with my

broom yeah like sorry sorry does like

smoke and like a bunch of like

children's faces or something like sorry

uh and then when I ate get up there is

that the same dragon man yes when you

last saw him he had a pair of golden

wing the spreading back and he was

flying up to the airship to greet you

you yes you know him as Xin Dhara

the quartermaster alright I will wave I

was hiding from him but I was peeking

over a crate so he might recognize me so

I'm like ah nice and dark remember being

yes yes I do

wait you guys know each other oh yeah

when I was with with omen and

acquisitions Inc he knows me

we don't mean you any harm or port 9

sorrow or any of that so I apologize if

our token caused you any grievance well

you know what things have just been

really hard and we just we're just kind

of don't want to leave any loose ends

the people that will come find us and

kill us later cuz there's probably like

12 of those right now so no we don't

mean any harm

and here you go and she'll like take a

cookie out of her robe and just like

toss it at him alright he will he will

let the cookie fall onto the dusty roof

and then use a mage hand to kind of hold

it up in the air while this is going on

evylyn you are being strangled to death

I need you to make a constitution saving

through

[Music]

Oh luckily isn't my Khan still buffed

even though I'm here yes

sick Lysander looks mean sander still

loves you yeah 15 okay you feel you're

so caught by surprise this thing starts

to choke you out

you almost pass out right away but

somehow you just managed to fight it off

even though the darkness is now swelling

behind your eyes as this thing tightens

around you I just got this party back

and at the we come to Paul tunes turn

right so said disc like now I'm gonna

ask him do you monitor the discs to even

see if they're received no we sort of

lose track of them actually hmm because

fall into the wrong hands right well I

take it upon myself to not take what

isn't mine and I figured maybe somebody

left this there for good reason but I

didn't assume it was for me so I just

carried on and didn't disturb it can i

deceive ya 25 he says oh alright then no

great loss zinder is it fair to assume

that you are part of Utica society if so

your secret is safe I help them out from

time to time certainly well if nothing

else you at least deliver a message for

us and let us let them know that

whatever a threat they were feeling was

not us it was clones of us and I love

you missed a kerfuffle the other day but

we actually dealt with it and just in

case they come back again

that's not ice either okay he says

following up to a point yes so there

could be more of them as what you're

saying we're then entirely sure Strix uh

it's bad news you have a hag problem

just so you know they live under the

city so we're a bad infestation yeah you

might want to like like like gas that

out or sign he asks you for details

about that like where in the city did

you see them oh yeah so go all into that

subway get there and she'll tell them

all about that say they're the sonne

sisters and wah wah that definitely

definitely definitely interests him and

he assures you that he will have it

checked out right cool and then she's

like that's where the clones are coming

from and they've also been cloning other

people and kidnapping people and

throwing them into a cauldron where

there's a big hole full of bodies and it

has a very rash of kidnappings lately

they're bad news we'll take care of it

I'm not one of them even though I smell

you don't smell to me and he says I

won't trouble you any further I will

take your message to the members of the

epic of society that I've been known to

talk to in the past and I'm sure this

will all blow over smoothly I wish you a

safe trip back to wherever it is you

call home much appreciated feel free to

reach me

we mean no harm to them and I hope thing

goes smoothly I'm sure is there like a

trouble yourself no further about it

right I know your typical you took a

society rules or anything but you guys

have like a an apology system or

anything like if you get the wrong

target or something you say sorry by

giving them say a small treasure

he says no great well maybe you could

get us out of the port we don't have

anything to give the dragon turtle and

you know the dragon turtle really well I

he says we're not on speaking terms but

yes I know aromat quite well Oh what can

we get what we give her we don't we're

not really rich we do things because we

have good hearts

unfortunately he says Aramaic is wise

I'm sure he will take only as much as

you can give might you take something

dangerous but expensive yes I'm sure

dragon turtles are like other dragons

arrogant they believe themselves able to

handle and triumph over anything hurts

just like smiles like great it's all I

needed to know great good all right you

see wait you see gold dragon wings a

sprout from his back and he takes to the

air neat

evylyn you get to go on your initiative

count of one hmm

you are being strangled by something

behind you that you can't see tight cord

wrapped around your neck what would you

like to do oh and at the start of your

turn you take some damage that I might

have some sort of resurrection nurse

like they're like they're saying I'm

glad they're on your side but also I

forgot that my aura protection applies

to me you did take a long word last five

I did so I don't Jack there you go so

actually it should have been a

twenty-one saving throw okay so you

didn't actually come close to blacking

out uh yeah so

boo-boo coming back from blah blah blah

blah blah so you've so yeah every time

you finish long rest the penalty is

reduced by one until it disappears so

you are currently minus three on your

attacker all saving throws and ability

checks okay then

18 which is fine attack girls - huh yeah

- three - three on all the good stuff

and as you're being choked out at the

start of your turn you took fifteen

points of damage cool so I imagine that

if I've been chilling in the bath I'm

probably not having my weapons on me

that is true

but I wasn't writing yeah and I imagine

I have a quill pen you do have a quill

pen so I'm gonna try to stab whoever it

is behind you I all right with the quill

pen making improvised the tack roll so

it's just a regular you don't add your

proficiency bonus to the attack 12 okay

uh-oh - three

okay yeah you you sort of weakened by

your Deathly ordeal you aren't able to

actually stick it in something it's kind

of blocked as you swing it around and

tried to stab it in the neck really

uncool as you're sort of flailing we're

having a spa day can't fight off this

person strangling her cuz her friends

didn't come to Papa

yeah and as you sort of flail and kick

around at the edge of the pool you hear

the sound of other sort of disturbances

in the water around you and that's when

that's start to try to pierce your flesh

but what's your AC without armor

basically just your decks bonus yeah my

decks bonus is - okay so you are you are

struck and you can see your blood kind

of begin to pour into the water as you

take another twenty seven points of

damage

and I need you to make a constitution

saving through you know this feels like

it feels like driving a brand new car

out of a lot and running right into okay

Constitution which equals out to minus

one or no plus two correct so you get to

order protection in your own

Constitution saving from yeah yeah okay

so my god teen died again okay so you

also take because no one would go and

they look back you also take 23 poison

damage okay top is it still worth it for

not being clean you know I'm sorry that

even one of the little hashtags self

care after being dead they tried to

throw strikes his hand away Evelyn will

circle back around actually you know

it's the guy who's strangling you turn

so I need you to make another

Constitution saving throw Oh fun I make

one on my turn and history you make a so

you make a constitution saving throw to

resist falling unconscious on his turn

you make a constitution saving throw

whenever you're stabbed by a poison

blade on your turn oh oh I see okay

oh well that's just an at one this is

Annette what okay that's great so you

pass out because what the rest of you do

or going back to the bathhouse to find

evil yeah high five have a party get a

couple of drinks and then we'll meet up

with our you know I played omen I don't

you uh

yeah our business with Xander is

resolved then III do things like that

the essential reaction would be to bike

all right well we can let evil and know

that everything is sorted maybe we get

ourselves some time in the bathhouse

when you get to the bathhouse you see if

there is

ruckus outside a bunch of priests

standing outside talking to guards oh

that's probably bad yeah and people just

sort of standing curiously out kind of

forming a horseshoe ring to see what is

actually going on inside but it's very

clear based on the tenor of the scene

that something bad has happened inside

the bat house I'm gonna try to closer

and closer as much as it possible to

kind of overhear what they're saying you

try to glean what's possibly going in

there yeah apparently two assassins

slipped into the bathhouse to murder an

individual inside that's all I needed to

hear I turned back pumps tricks in like

get back in there as fast as possible

are they gonna let us in don't care so

you the guards actually do try to

prevent you from going inside if you

want to try to slip past them you can

either use stealth or just the

acrobatics to slip invisibility for me

ease ability would work as well uh Diaz

would not have time to sneak around then

he had too much from such an urgency so

you'd rather use acrobatics or to kind

of break through and himself go ahead

and make a check all right against there

opposed by their strength athletics

that's right for evil in nineteen okay

one of the guards actually catches you

 and kind of pushes you back out but

you feel something invisible brush past

you and go inside as you are held if an

August if all gets through that's fine

when the guard catches a stretch just

reach out and touch him and turn him

into a cloud DF absolutely this is like

straight-up staring at the guard just

like really weird and she just touches

every okay yes you do DF as soon as you

become a cloud a couple of the priests

say that's exactly what the assassins

did Wow balls then I turn into a cloud

[Laughter]

yes paltin when you go inside and you

sort of make your way through chambers

you follow the crowd and the ruckus to

where the scene of the crime happened

and you see a pool red with blood and at

the edge of that pool you see evylyn

basically kind of sitting in a recliner

chair as a couple priests wave at her

she is alive wounded and coming to her

senses

evylyn after you went blank you don't

remember anything until you were

awakened by two wet cat people who told

you that they they startled the

assassins and scared them off and so you

are basically on this chaise lounge

reclined clutching you know you're

wounded as they're bandaging you up you

you can probably heal yourself at this

point since you've kind of regained your

senses if you have a lay on hands okay

my party is here they see me you don't

see anybody from your party you see you

see some priests of soon you see some

guards who were called in and you see

these two drenched cat people one of

them looks like you've met you've met

two Baxi before or seen them in port

lions are ooh this appears to be a male

and a female the male sort of got a

golden tawny coat and the females got

more of silvery gray Sheen to her fur

but they talked to each other like

they've known each other for a very long

time and she comes to then she's just

putzing around on the body of doing like

lay on hands like smoothing off the

wound and like you know like like she's

like putting on lotion you know like

[Music]

and then she she's like thank you so

much what what yeah the band you heard

the guards question the tutu back see

apparently their names are River mist

and flask of wine ah they showed up here

to be pampered and they came upon you

being accosted by two assassins in the

water lept into the water onto the

assassins back raped at the madly with

their claws until the assassins finally

broke off and fled and the assassins

kind of turned into water snakes as they

slithered out of the bathhouse you also

I would imagine that the smell of blood

in the water would be like overpowering

- even right now so I think she is like

kind of reacting to that - a little yeah

well the blood it's kind of turn the

water a pinkish hue so it's not that so

saturated that it's it in fact the smell

the broad probably isn't greater than

the perfume scent that was in the water

okay so your oh well then then she's

fine and as Health paltin do you want to

stay invisible or reveal yourself at any

point um okay so what what's so there's

the to cap evil is evil and Cappy

Arthur's there's two priests of the bath

house tending to evil in and there's a

couple guards interrogating the two cat

people not interrogation questioning

them yeah if palton does see me I assume

I'm not wearing my boots right now right

probably not not in the water yeah so

this would be the first time that

palton would notice that evylyn actually

her leg ends below the knee at her left

leg ends below the knee she sees this is

like huh question for later I'm gonna

stay invisible okay but then I'm gonna

try and like get behind her okay just so

I can like how closes are the are they

to her she just kind of like alone right

now

she's they sort of move back and forth

like they'll bring her a towel or though

they'll they'll check her bandages about

once every three or four minutes and

remove them take them away they'll bring

her a drink

basically the priests are doing their

utmost to prove that this play you know

they feel terrible that assassin slipped

in here and kind of wrecked Evelyn's

experience and so they're doing their

utmost to pamper and tender her but they

do leave her alone for brief periods of

time enough that you could like whisper

in an ear or talk to her in low tones

even tries to hold hands with the tabac

see who saved her a lot okay she's just

like thanking them and like rubbing

their rubbing their paws on her face and

like you know just I'm so sorry to be

such a burden I just I just wanted a

spot in I just ruined it for everybody

and now the pools all gross Oh um at a

moment where she's a little more alone

I'm just gonna like tell her really

quietly I'm assuming I don't have

ok so she'll know my voice so I'll just

be like hey okay don't panic don't panic

don't panic calm down calm down calm

down calm down I'm in here oh I don't

think I'm supposed to be in here but if

you can it's a dive I've also been very

I've been I've been I've been show her

ass I have not I've not been looking so

that's not an issue

um just it's like when you can get out

of here we're all outside

last I checked and just get it going

when you can okay okay yeah it's tricks

what do you do now that you're both gas

clouds standing outside and the guards

around you were kind of freaking out

also as invisible I would like to leave

okay can we just chill until these see

evil and come out uh if he's still

invisible we won't see him come out oh

yeah we won't see paltin come out all

right if I'm coming out what I happen to

recognize said clouds well I was just

gonna ask since you guys don't know

what's going on in the bathhouse or

where palton is relative to evil in or

even if evil ends alive what are the two

gas clouds do

in these mouna go into the bathroom yeah

we're still trying to use it okay then

you they can't stop you so you're able

to basically float in ya room to room

and wrap and you probably Walton as

you're leaving the chamber where Evelyn

is in and kind of stepping out of the

hall you probably come face to face with

the two gas clouds who are being

followed by the guards and now III it's

do is it safe for me to assume that I

know what these clouds are yes they're

there they bear a striking likeness to

your two friends gonna be like guys

she's fine she'll be out soon and get

out of here yep alright to the guards

I'm just gonna keep like sneaking as I

say that I'm like I'm still getting that

okay

then I guess as clouds' like dia

fistrick's turn to each other

mm-hm and then just kind of a couple of

the guards shrugged their shoulders in

confusion as you start to drift back out

we'll follow you back out and when you

emerge some people are startled by the

forms of death and strikes as they

emerge from the bathhouse wait so when

they're clouds is it just like cloud

versions of them yes yeah basically oh

my god this whole time I thought they

were literal clouds I'm like what why

would they like follow like mist I

didn't realize they're like they're like

like mmm like mushroom looking people

yeah exactly yeah mushroom marshmallow

yeah I always picture strix is with a

witch hat too

yeah so just like oh okay that's less

discreet than I thought yeah so once

you're all back outside and at this

point in time basically untouchable to

the guards are you just hanging out

around here you're gonna drift away you

said wait for eat wait you'll be out so

I guess yeah okay you know I'll just

make a game of mocking the guards as a

cloud are these guards just standing

there like it's like we're gonna wait

till you're done yeah pretty much yeah

oh my gotta wear off sometime okay so

you're hanging out there evylyn what do

you do at this point in time the Tabac

see are going to be treated by the

hood to the finest that the bath house

has to offer

it was flask of wine and what was the

other one's name River mist River miss I

want to spend time talking to River miss

um Faust of wine and like profusely

thank them for saving me and ask if

there's anything I can do in return well

they they do work in the city and

outside the city a great deal and you

know life in the city can be expensive

if you know any opportunities for them

anybody who might be looking for guides

into child perhaps they would be very

grateful oh you need money here

I have 35 gold and I just give that to

them Oh like you take it out of whatever

your parcel of stuff is yeah and yeah

they won't turn it down they say thank

you and they they hope that you have a

better day from this point forward and

they bid you farewell and if anyone asks

for a god I'll be sure to tell them but

I think I only have like um 20 more

minutes till my ship leaves so I'm not

sure how they say it not really I mean

but we have passage on a ship but it's

unclear whether a dragon turtles gonna

try to eat us when we leave I don't know

it's kind of a thing they they seem to

know about our Meg yeah we have to go to

water deep I'd rather stay here but but

yes they take that they take the gold

they sort of parcel it away in their

pouches

alright well thanks appreciate it

and then as I'm leaving is there like a

like a you said the managers are kind of

like administering to us and like

getting the finest a good offer yeah

are they are they gonna try to charge me

for oh no no okay

so it was all complimentary yeah I I

mentioned that you know if they felt

like maybe replacing my garments that

had been really damaged that that might

you know yes yeah well they will allow

you to pick out of their parlour

anything that fits that you think is

gonna work with your own salt what kind

they have most of them are light

diaphanous summer weather summer weather

we're because port 9s are was so humid

and warm okay I pick what I think is the

most appropriate for sailing so I think

I'm in like resort where okay and then I

feel like massive floppy hat sandals

sundress and then I just put my armor

over that okay oh my god you come out

you're weird sort of diaphanous clothing

it's kind of bunching out from under

your arm or in weird places and yeah

okay evylyn does emerge eventually the

guards are aware that she was the victim

of this attack they don't hinder her and

but they do ask if you're going to file

any report uh you know we just don't

really have time so it's fine it's

nothing that hasn't happened before

yeah I mean I don't know do I am I

reunited with my party you see you do

see gasps ADEA and guests tricks out

there being surrounded by guards do you

guys think we should file a report

oh there with you yeah all unclouded

as soon as they say that like okay good

yeah if evil and you take custody of

your gassy friends they're not so gassy

friends they will let them go we're just

trying to help her

sorry I think just you know don't worry

about it we we just know that if ever we

come by Scheldt again we will have

friends at the saloon back house won't

we or safe so whatever this bad guys

soon all right are we leaving yes as

well as we're like walking away like I'm

still invisible so I kind of want to

just like walk by one of the guards

yeah just like flick them on the ear and

make them think another guard did it

then just okay those two guards get into

an arc

[Laughter]

all right so even when you got your

stuff all sort of slung over your

shoulder and you're making your way

along and these strange new garments

that you've acquired all my gear as

usual except a pretty dress underneath

it right and you slap your boots you

slap your boots back on yeah yeah and

it's all they're all clean they're

resplendent great paltin you can't take

your eye off that foot you're like so

along the way back as evil and just kind

of flies alongside the party yeah

d/f will explain to her everything it

had happened with cinder and that we got

the the our troubles cleared up that

wasn't meant for us we're actually clean

they one can be coming after us so now

there's no more confusion we're good

here one was really excited to try to

tell the stuff she found out like she

helped and then yeah it was like oh yeah

we already fixed we figured it all out

and fixed it all so we could give the

dragon turtle the bomb and he'll love it

all right well good thing show up I

didn't come with you guys because it

sounds like you didn't need me at all so

and I just got into trouble somebody

else bailed you out yeah yeah sorry we

left you alone you got in trouble so so

and so like walk up and grab evylyn by

the shoulders and say never say we won't

need you it hurts and then she just

keeps walking all right back at the ship

the captain and crew are ready to go as

you board the vessel captain Orton may

will tell you that the sloop doesn't

it's mostly it's got a big top deck the

crew spends most of their time up there

and they've got the ship well under hand

they don't need any help from you there

is a compartment or a little sort of

house at the back of the ship where you

can go inside and make yourselves

comfortable in a shared cabin with

enough room that you can kind of lay

your stuff out in separate corners and

there's like a hammock for each of you

waffles will be and you will be a tight

fit in here but waffles can sleep on the

deck out front or okay just as long as

we make sure you have levels and Simon

yes and the ship pulls leaves the dock

heads out across the harbour and into

the bay and then raises its sails to

catch the warm wind racing toward the

strait and as you get close to the

strait or to may will just knock on your

door and tell you that you're

approaching chances are mag doesn't

always show up when a ship passes

through the Strait but often ships

leaving are intercepted particularly if

they seem heavy of hold right we saw the

plan for this what if we tell them we're

poor we're going to look they're an

arrogant dragon turtle

they'll want the most powerful thing

that we have and that is that crazy bomb

that you'll just take the key out and

then we'll throw it off the ship how

about the dub okay cuz taking the key

out we're assuming it's gonna like start

it back up right well it's a dragon they

can handle it they want to handle the

scariest things the worst things and

that's definitely the worst thing we

have yeah that's the fear Bolton yeah so

what if we just give them the bomb with

the key still in it it's like those

can't go so bad how do how do we know

that that won't kill us right so why

don't we just give it as is I can't I

can't just leave a key oh we can't we'll

just well take it out and then open a

dimension door and throw it down towards

the grid dragon turtle Evil's looking at

paltin like for once she's like thinks

those two are crazy and they are the

only two people who understand reality

she's like how how I don't understand

how this doesn't make sense

giant bomb huge kaboom yeah so it's like

okay so really quick let's go over it so

we can't give him the key why refresh me

because

for whatever reason she Mishka wants

them and the more she gets that it more

dangerous things become okay so where

are we gonna be like here's your key

also it's in a bomb Lowell didn't you

think she can't get that I don't know we

shouldn't give her the bomb very

tempting but no okay well cuz here's the

thing

you know I don't want to be blown up I

know it's really weird it's a soup it's

like it's a weird preference thing it's

not for everyone but for me living is

kind of working so how about we not blow

ourselves up because you're assuming

that this Drakken can stop the explosion

that's dragon that we heard about like

an hour ago it's really big I've seen it

I flew over it and really bad and yeah

that's a big if not bigger than Klaus

it's massive and you want to throw an

active bomb at it I'll go to my room and

take the key out and throw it it'll be

fine you know hey can I just point

something out here

when it palton cared this much about a

plan it might be that there's a

dangerous problem with it the serious

problem is that it entails me dying in

I'm so not about that life

here Paulson and she'll just like we had

him her broom and be like you don't want

to die you can fly in the broom and I'll

just myself then you blow up then like

that sis do you like stop trying to stop

stop that solution like it's really

crestfallen when you seal stops like the

solution isn't like hey look an

explosion let me throw myself at it

that's not gonna fix it hold on let me

check something can I see the bomb for

just a minute

who has it I forgot to put it on my

backpack okay I just need to see it I'm

not doing anything she's like ruffling

stuff I think it was in there I'm pretty

sure yeah now there yeah yeah I'm not

doing anything I just want to see it you

see I just got this song sticking out

all right it has been some time since I

looked at this Chris yeah I would like

to once again re-examine the mechanisms

and try to figure out generally how much

time is actually left on the timer

because when I first deactivated it I

thought it's only a minute left yeah and

after all the hijinks it seemed like it

was more than a minute so I might have

been wrong so I just want to

double-check and see if I can still

figure out exactly how much time is left

make a intelligence Arkana check Arcana

can I just point out as you're examining

this that I actually don't think it's

cool to just like bomb a dragon that's

never done anything to us

and also that could do something to

write that let's take me closer doesn't

kill it karna check 15 I can I assist

coz I have that uh yeah you can stand

over his shoulder and point the stuff so

you get advantage on the check okay

eighteen hard to say but you adventure

to guess that just a few seconds Oh a

few seconds yep

okay so so it's got a few you think it's

got a few seconds so there's literally

no way you we can do that without

leaving the key in I think both is right

you hear a knock on the door and you

hear or anybody's voice says I think I'm

gonna come out here I am mate and I can

deal with mate and yeah what do you go

outside the door some a warm wind has

picked up and evil and as you kind of

look around the ship is sailing through

the Strait of the Bay of Kult and you

can see that there is a storm a-brewing

ahead out in the open sea and you're

starting to get the the brush of that

but it is sort of whipping some of the

palm trees and things on the high ridges

to each side of you on the landmasses

that sort of form the pincer claw around

the bay and as that picks up the waters

in the Strait do seem to churn a little

bit more but there is something

there that is looks like an island at

first and then sort of goes down under

the water ahead Oh No

Alton is just like all right I'm so you

know what fine keep your keep your bum

keep your key it's fine and he's just

like it likes it likes magic right

that's what we've established if we

don't anibal's valuables money treasure

whatever they are all right wait Chris

they said like magic stuff too right mhm

yeah it's like all right fine and he

just takes out his mandolin just like

Chuck sit at their feet it's just like

use that just just throw it in I don't

give a dude it just goes back to

the room not gonna do anything if I'm

dead so it doesn't make a difference but

how will you fly already on how are you

fly I'll talk to the dragon turtle okay

I have I have pile of pretty things I

got some magic stuff I'll figure it out

okay

okay even goes flying toward the dragon

turtle okay as you fly off the ship you

see that the dragon turtle is underwater

and making its way toward the ship on an

intercept course but it is underwater

Judah's kind of hangs out like not

trying to engage it but waiting until it

surfaces okay it surfaces next to the

ship and the rest of you on the ship see

this guy get gargantuan shell rise up

water cascading off of it

no not be it's it's all sort of ejected

and encrusted with barnacles you can

actually see there's like an anchor

stuck in part of it and as its fleshy

head rises up you see that the head is

about the size of gaash a building and

it's smile if you can call it that is

big enough to drive a wagon through and

seems to billow out of its and nostrils

as it rises and turns its head toward

the ship you see that the water around

the vessel now becomes just like this

churning Maelstrom or cauldron around

this gargantuan behemoth and as you

stare into its face you see that one of

its eyes is clouded over with cataracts

and there's like all this sort of burn

and scar damage around it that looks

quite old so it's really looking at you

through its one good eye I kind of

curtsy in midair oh wow you're real big

and and beautiful hello my name is

Evelyn and I represent those traveling

on this ship and I'm hoping that we can

present an offering that is satisfactory

to you I have this pile of pretty things

and I would love if you would take those

and then also I noticed your eye doesn't

look real good would you like some

healing all right you sort of throw it

in its mouth it sort of falls onto its

tongue and down into its gullet and it

says yes oh I have the most amazing

thing do you like music you don't why

can I hear it's voice yes everybody can

hear it's voice is your Paulding it's

like just give it um what about that

healing did your eye do you want any

healing it says

I don't care about your spells I don't

need your pity

just your treasure I'll go back out

there

yes we'll call out evil in know how she

pulls out fungus people am I am

everybody's out there yeah I'm just

gonna take up the mandolin just throw it

in one hand well make it actually just

make a dicks

dexterity savings rather to catch the

mandolin

as you swoop down this is the third not

one I just say though because before I

was doing that before he did that or at

the same time I was also pulling out the

holy symbol of Raven kinda oh sure you

can pull that out the mandolin goes out

into the water and just sort of Bob's up

and down on the surface of these

churning waves wait does that imply it

didn't make it or no it you threw it

over it just hasn't sunk into the water

it's a sort of next reason to look at it

it does look at it and see sort of like

these lightning marks and storm clouds

worked into its design and it does seem

kind of entranced by it for a moment and

then Strix takes it everybody roll

initiative okay you're just gonna hand

it to him okay so you're holding it up

in front of him

and you're bargaining with him but you

see that its attention is now on this

mandolin you know did you want to try to

grab it from the mage hand you don't

have to try to shove the holy symbol of

Raven kind in its eye and not like in

its eye but you know like in its view

okay and be like know this instead diner

picked everyone just stop it's gonna

take everything you throw at it so I

mean if there's anything else you don't

want then please okay yeah I will never

say no to treasure I try to take the

mandolin back and say this instead don't

all right evilly please could we just

everybody roll initiative

it doesn't like being given something

and having it taken away

everybody rolled please

six no six force tricks is that Oh Anna

come on okay

not 20 Oh God I'm going to talk to it

okay df8 eight strix seventeen what

would you like to do paltin um I see

he's like getting hostile you see yeah

he he is aghast that something would be

offered to him and then snatched back in

replacement for something I I'm gonna

tell me like we weren't taking it back

we we weren't faking you out

we simply noticed that it just could

have used a little polish and we wanted

only the shiniest treasure for you yes

we should only give him the greatest

treasure that we have and I would like

to I don't know what that would qualify

as make a persuasion check seventeen

okay

he doesn't seem swayed Alton it's all

right I think you're right we can give

him the bomb with the key giving him

everything yeah let's or waffles in

there - why not

no look as long as the bomb stays with

us it's the slightest jostle could

decimate all of us dangerous if he takes

it and just keeps it safe then we don't

and then we don't have to worry about

that John I need her to Wasser

everything around us wherever we are

wherever we end up keeping that with us

is more dangerous than getting rid of it

you see or to make Ruth row open up sort

of a chest with some golden and then

toss that over into the sea Boosh if

this means giving up a key with it to

keep all of us and who knows wherever we

end up safe then we'll do that

but you guys are asking to give up

pieces of yourselves you can't can't do

that

I'm sorry I only collect garbage don't

have anything to give up palton you want

to do anything else on your attorney

besides talk oh you actually use an

action to make a check so okay so yeah

Strix do you want to do anything there's

not much I can do so I don't know where

the bomb is where's the bomb yeah that's

it yeah

yeah that's it okay um all right she's

just gonna stare okay

d/f the key comes out of the bomb on its

own and goes into the water and evil

evil paltin appears next to you and then

turns to good politics says hey if you

don't want that mendelian is like

you buddy also you and me we're gonna

talk later he looks at the bomb and says

do you think so and then it is yeah just

turn how quickly oh okay first off uh

fast hands faster than ever put another

key right into it I try to like stop the

bomb again and I'm keeping a hand on

there okay you stick it in the bomb

stops ticking good I kick evil paltin

okay

evylyn what do you do evil palms like

how many of those do you have I see all

this happening on the deck right connect

I want to make a mint I make my melee

attack against evil Paulding like I want

to kick him oh you actually wanted not

just like kick him as in like a boot to

the ass you actually want to well I'm

taking him got it okay like over ideally

nah go ahead and since this is if your

intention is to shove him off the deck

with a kick

make a strength athletics check versus

his strength athletics check love oh

 nineteen

oh okay yeah so you push him and he

goes into the drink and then I noticed

that the same times being seeing me fall

that was that was disorienting yeah I

did not like that

all right yes he goes over into the

water into the churning water

evylyn what do you do do I know that

that is evil paulding oh yeah so your

friends told you that there were clones

of you running around doing evil

and I mean it looks like paltin but

longer hair and but they kind of look

you know I'm gonna roll a perception

check okay what how hard do you think it

will be for Egeland to know in in that

split second when she sees paulson fall

off the boat

yeah how hard do you think it is

probably not hard yeah we we still owe

Jesus Christ okay well yeah yeah palton

just went over and you're not sure why

he's that diet again evil nuc paulten

floundering around in the churning water

alright

you she dives for him and he grabs on to

you as you waste him out of the water

and the dragon Turtles like can I yell

everybody know driving yeah give it to I

okay so I guess actually if I see

paulten on deck saying huh That's not me

oh yeah give it to him I would I would

think that it would all click in place

and I throw evil palton to the dragons

okay it's like stop taking these from

him he is going to try to hold on to you

or actually know more precisely he's

going to try to grab the mandolin as you

hurl him

so go ahead and just make a opposed

strength check I need to use different

diets this is ridiculous

seven I'm sorry seven okay I'm getting

out my other guys don't worry okay can I

roll it better guys well now you're all

to seven so okay so you were able to

throw him off he snatches the mandolin

as he falls and he says it's mine haha

and then goes into the Dragon turtles

mouth you got it and then the dragon

turtle just sort of swallows him well he

got it I have to look up the Mendelian

powers that I have it here because I was

gonna use it today didn't think that's

how but hey it's got cure wounds dispel

magic fly invisibility levitate

protection from energy lightning only

and protection from evil and good okay

her had rather and still pass not a

temper tantrum and threw it at a turtle

dragon all right so you once got it work

even grab palton and then hurled him

away and now it is Paul toons turn Elin

feels very weird about having fed any

parts into a turtle dragon I'm going to

tell him again be like okay look we we

gave you we gave you your mandolin we

gave you your magic dude well what we've

given you so we've literally given you

everything we could possibly give you

can you please just please just grant us

passage make another persuasion check

oh okay that is a 27 it says and it

moves away from the ship constricts try

to jump in and get the key yes please

Strix get the key please do not take

anything else from him Jesus

he's already leaving it's just the key

you see him don't you see him basically

kind of going down away and then down

under the water okay see this big sort

of weird but the back fins come up no I

threw it overboard you're gonna go down

in the water vulture self so that she

can breathe underwater

alright you're still on your broom uhm

if it's faster to look around yeah it's

she's selling her broom underwater which

is kind of fun yeah so she's goes right

down right down into the water like work

underwater right right as he leaves I

just immediately go from like standing

to just or tomates a hand on your

shoulder and just sort of says well done

smoothly I look like

thank you yeah there's a standing at the

edge of the boat holding the bomb and

still the other key Ange like looking

overboard panicking he'll serve a panic

just watching for Strix and make sure

she's getting it or she's getting it or

she's okay or whatever okay well like to

imagine you can see like a little green

light

underwater just like yeah alright Helen

will fly back to palton as he collapsed

on the deck and she'll kind of like sit

down next I'm gonna be like why did you

do that

Strix make a perception check you have

dark vision so that's helpful that is

helpful

it's actually quite deep in the straight

so you're going down quite a ways the

ship the ship's hull lit from the sky

above looks kind of small by the time

you look up

it again oh that's not no it's not plus

amazing

so 14 okay you're not able to find the

key you do see that the dragon turtle is

turning its great bulk down toward you

can I look again

sure okay I'm just gonna keep looking

go ahead make another check oh that's

really good

that's uh 19 you do see it's shining

down on a reef and you grab hold of it

and that's when the dragon turtle

attacks you only it only rolled it to on

its attack well so that's a that's a 14

to hit your AC um yeah that's still that

still hit okay then it will bite you for

I'm sorry

if someone says stop taking his stop

stop taking his stuff and yet still it's

like we're gonna take your stuff Strix

as it comes in it just sort of opens its

big beak like ma and you see it's a

lower jaw just kind of shovel across the

ground gathering up the ground as well

like it's gonna try to clamp you right

on the ground and so as it's choking

down all kinds of stuff and coming at

you with its open jaws it by clamps down

on you for 25 points of damage and I'm

okay and then it as it goes past you

slashes at you with its claws hitting

you for another 27 points of damage

hold on well I have to do math wait hold

on

seven anything I think I'm still okay

wait that's 40 that's uh what was the

first one 27 and 25 okay so that would

be 52 points of damage

haha okay all right and as it goes past

you what do you do is too scared if I

stole the key I'm just gonna determine

I'm just gonna if I could dimension door

back onto the ship you kind of have to

see where your dimension during to so

you could dimension door next to the

ship but you can't see the top deck from

underneath it okay um might I okay hmm

that will get you far enough away from

it that I want people to attack you

immediately okay I want to mention door

next to the ship and just yell she is

bobbing up and down in the water the

rest of you can try to pull her up if

you want

she'll just to grab on okay

she's like go go go go go I'm so handy

at the key back and be like here we go

Paulding seize the key it's like you

took something back from him didn't you

that was it give it to him it was thrown

in the water by his unstable person did

he was it in his vicinity no was it in

the water he left I consider the water

his vicinity he seems a little

possessive DFC is tricks his wounds in

right of way he's like is evylyn help

that's fine she like throws up on the

deck I think my insides are falling out

the dragon turtle surfaces bearing its

huge jaws and collapse down on the side

of the ship and you hear the crunching

of wood as it digs its

upper beak into the vessel what

what does palton do

colonists I will say to the dragon again

like please forgive my friend she does

not know what she was doing she didn't

mean it the holdups are still the list

toward it you can see it is basically

backpedaling and pulling the ship on its

side as if it's doing drag it do I see

the key

you see the key yes can i grab the key

and just throw it at him it's like this

is yours you can't grab it if DF has it

then Nagurski can't technically grab it

here can i please give him the key can

we start we seem like the dragon Turtles

like mouth biting on to it it's clamped

on to the ship and is basically dragging

the ship down underwater a very good

space that you could potentially throw

something into his mouth it's the mouth

is so big I would say yes I mean he also

took stuff just throwing water mm-hmm so

you can just throw whatever I do you

look over up halton and just to the

dragon's mouth

wait the key went back into the bomb

I had another you knew it yes no I'm

talking about didn't didn't Strix just

take a key yes do yeah the key that evil

palton pulled out of the bomb he threw

into the water that's the one that Strix

recovered to keep the bomb keep the bomb

from going off deaath used another one

of his keys and stuck it in the egg I

was talking about the key that that she

took back yeah that's the one that he is

so DF still has that key yes now he is

now taking out the second key oh no no

no no not that key not that key the one

we already gave him I don't think yeah

there's not I don't think death is going

to give up either key but that's what

all right so it is actually Strix astern

but he threw the bomb at the turtle not

yet that will happen on D s turn which

is right after you can see it in his eye

you know right after Strix

well yeah if I could see he's gonna do

that Strix is just like can you make him

the key out as I throw it yeah

absolutely I can ready a mage hand yeah

Moulton is literally going to drink all

the wine on his it's just like last

drink yeah evylyn swipes it from him and

takes a drink - yeah waffles just

started digging her claws into the hull

of the ship to keep from sliding off

Simon is basically holding on to her for

pour one out for waffles yeah and he's

the mage hand so you pull the key out DF

you hurl the bomb well yeah like I throw

it up in midair okay Strix can like take

the key out God and as DF throws it even

say fine this is our greatest treasure

okay

and just are you trying to toss it just

up in the air and into the water or into

its mouth you said right okay I see this

right yeah Paul is just like wow season

four was two episodes and after throwing

it the effect he looks over at paltin

and in his eyes only just conveys the

deepest sorrow regret and just trying to

apologize without saying anything the

dragon turtle unclench is the ship which

writes itself suddenly as you all sort

of now slosh about on deck and the

dragon turtle sort of sinks down into

the water go go all right captain order

Magus tries to get the ship going as

fast as it can out of this straight

we're still not in the clear that

signifi all right you see a big flash of

ooh energy underneath the water that

seems to swell up like a balloon being

inflated the deep below and the water

just pushes outward and then there's a

huge white explosion that erupts from

the straight up into the air throwing

water high into the sky even grabs

paltin all right the ship is just sort

of blown forward on this great swell of

water and just thrust so that it's bow

comes up out of the water completely and

only the back end of the ship is even

touching the the sea and with masterful

aplomb the crew under the guidance of

captain autumn a surfs this wave for

about half a mile before the ship

settles calmly outside the bay of child

I just pushes forward a whole bunch

speedrun tactics you're welcome we're

never going back to Java and you see

what you saw behind you in the flashing

light was it went out so far from the

straight that it basically incinerated

all of the trees on the rocks on either

side of the pincer that you guys just

exited do I have a gauge of so how far

are we from where that just happened

you're about a quarter mile oh that's

okay it's been a while since I mapped

what is roughly that in feet a lot a lot

is it that's well is it more than a

thousand yeah

damn it

even looks at Diaz and says you blow up

Paulson's mandolin that we can get of a

new mandolin we're going to we're going

to water deep we could ask omen so how

to cut to cut to what nyan Zaru

where everybody in the city sees this

gigantic bloom of magical energy

swelling up from the bay of child and

then are struck by a wave of force that

basically blows out all of their windows

and actually tears through masts and

sails and windows and brick before it

abates and people start to regain their

sense of calm as they look out toward

the harbor the statue in the harbor is

toppled and - well - - back sea are

sitting on a patio spending Evelyn's

coin like kings when two assassins sit

down with them and ask where have they

gone

and the tabacky say water deep and

that's where we'll pick up crazy this

all could have been solved with the

mandolin it could yes you're right I

know oh no you're right oh this sucks
