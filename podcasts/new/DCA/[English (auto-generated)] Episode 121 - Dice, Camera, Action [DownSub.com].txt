everybody and welcome to dice camera

action a D&D show yeah our

second-to-last before the end of 2018

greets us and previously in dice camera

action the waffle crew were duped into

an ambush at house growl hunt by some

doppelgangers intent on robbing their

home and perpetrating other crimes no

doubt in the course of escaping house

growl hund and returning to the waffle

house the crew set upon two

doppelgangers killing one of them and

capturing the other a d/f look-alike

named claw Rio and putting him

evylyn basically slapped to the manacles

on him and we ended the session with

pleura Oh being taken into the waffle

crews custody at the Waffle House there

was some disarray waffles got all ornery

and tried to go after the doppelgangers

and rekted door Jencks had a harrowing

encounter with two of the doppelgangers

that left him a little fraught and

squiddly went off and tumbled a keg of

smoke powder down some stairs which

thankfully didn't blow up in his

friend's face he's helping he is sure is

yep absolutely

and so we will kind of pick up around

there or shortly thereafter with the

doppelganger in the waffle crews custody

in their home now my question to you is

what would the waffle crew like to do

with their captive shove them into a

closet pending further discussion wait

do we have a wee decision when we were

using one closet for squidly already so

like

there's a there's let's see kha'zix

closets closets the private baths off of

Holton's bedroom there is the pretty off

of Portland's bedroom which is secure

and has no windows so it could be duly

confined to there that's probably the

and then there's another one actually

south of the library study area oh yeah

there you can tuck them in that probably

sees even less use and where the turret

- yes but the turret has windows okay

yeah don't want that there's also not a

great claim as evidenced by the wounds

he has sustained he doesn't do very well

scaling the outsides of buildings but

you basically put him in a privy shove a

a chair under the door and he's pretty

secure at that point all right cool

great um that's on the that's on the

third floor

got it that's the one so it's like okay

yeah Strix is also immediately going to

go up to DF and explain the fact that he

strained her face touched her and that

she's cursed and that's how that

conversation goes that's what she says

she just walks up and says that okay and

so after hearing that it's like a Susy

athere's that he touched her face do you

mean he goes he did what

it immediately walks over opens up the

privy and then immediately just grabs

pluriel by the throat okay oh you sleeve

strikes of the bat like after yeah like

wait why is that bad am I cursed oh so

you got pleura oh by the throat yeah got

her drawn Alton it's like back in a mob

just like yeah what'd you do she was

like if I touched your face am I not

cursed anymore don't touch his face you

know no we're touched no one's face she

touches her face she's like what are we

just saying

don't touch things sorry there will be

no face touching I touched my own this

is the face touch free zone she goes to

touch your face

he's gonna wash away just like well this

is while this is going on evil and

you're downstairs and you hear somebody

come in to the bakery on the ground

floor and knowing since life has been so

precarious today what with ambushes and

whatnot you are generally concerned we

have a customer I don't know what to do

with customers all right Dan three right

away with this sword

hello more closed I was told to make

money I run downstairs open we want your

money

we barely use money as it is we have

other stuff to deal with Strix you run

downstairs and you see that it is all

Correa's Stone marrow your silent dwarf

Archmage business partner and she's

holding a letter in her hand and just

sort of flapping it in the air and she

says this was on your doorstep hello

friend I talked to the black staff the

other day I think she's mad at me it

appears to be addressed to you evylyn oh

I get disappointed for a second thinking

that like maybe I could be pen pals with

the black staff or something and I take

it I'm like alright it's good to see you

Corey is DF about I think so

he ran away with his sword I think he

might be killing I wish to speak with

him okay um I'll be right back uh just

wait here and I'll just like point to

the PI's go ahead pick yourself out of

pie and I'll go I'll go grab these don't

look very fresh all right I will get you

one from the oven shortly why will would

you like a drink first I'll go to the

tap and be like no just D F okay let's

put down the drink it might be a second

cuz he might be killing something I'll

just go just remember I'm old and don't

live for

ever imagine can make you live forever

we and then I realize there's so by the

time Strix gets up there do us basically

like has him up against the wall like

got her like pressed up near his throat

in Florio still in his manacles still

claiming to be redness yeah pollens

behind him like like just doing hype

testers like yeah what you gonna do we

do what we gonna do with that and rag

Ness is just probably saying something

like hey I'm sorry I thought this is

just how you showed each other you can't

I call us I meant no harm of it I swear

and yes it's just in like pure rage mode

like you shut up when you're talking to

us you got it was like alright dude what

are we gonna do with them beat him up

d/f will say we're gonna get every

single thing that he knows and after

that if we're merciful don't kill him

we gonna torture this Terry I feel ya

hey strikes is like listening missus

she's like you said you see Simon

standing next to fault him just like so

or choreo was downstairs she said she

wanted to see you do yes I told her that

you would probably be killing someone

and you might be a little while because

of the stranger face touch uh without

being like looking back at Strix like he

still just got like glory Oates like

slammed up like sword pointed and just

goes can you ask him if he cursed me you

owe me you want me to hold down the fort

while you go yeah please

and then you'll like like still grabbing

my throat actually like slam them up

again

like intentially said like his head hits

the back wall as much as possible and

then diesel put a sword his way take a

few breaths to kind of like calm himself

down and make his way downstairs okay

well it was just like wringing his hands

like we bout to fire a bullet this one

you go I got this just meanwhile if you

like flashback to evylyn there's like

elevator music and she's just kind of

standing there like I'm sure Strix won't

be but a moment comfortable oh yeah we

appreciate your patronage yes Rick sort

of handed you the letter as well even

for you you were standing there before

she ran upstairs so will you excuse me

just a moment I have to respond to some

professional correspondence okay so you

can take your leave mm-hmm I just go

stand somewhere away sit Tony the letter

make a perception check that will be 14

okay the letter is clearly addressed to

you at the spires of the morning so it

must have come to here from there and

then somebody must have just left it

outside and maybe they docked on the

door and you didn't hear them you're not

sure but you were the 14 that is enough

to recognize that the handwriting on the

outside of the envelope is your

brother's and boy it's been a long time

since you've seen that Oh

even she goes to just like put it in her

pocket and then she takes it back out

and she goes to open it and then she's

like and puts it back in her pocket

and then she takes it back out and she

does this like a few times when finally

she's like oh and she just opens it and

reads it okay

as you're reading it some customers some

actual customers seem to come into the

shop a little and just you hear the

ringing of the Bell over the door and

then they sent comes sauntering in first

it appears to be two kids about maybe

eight nine ten possibly years old a girl

and a boy you suspect they might be

brother and sister or cousins or

something because there is a resemblance

between them but they seem to be roughly

the same age and they are in the company

of a tiefling woman who maybe they're

obviously not their mother but a

guardian or a warden or somebody and the

kids seem to just sort of run in and

immediately go to the pies in the

counter and start pointing and AH going

over the the goodies under glass the

tiefling woman kind of looks around

looks across a tall quarry and kind of

gives her a hard gaze and this tiefling

woman has a pipe that she's been smoking

and she's wearing a red kimono with a

sash tied around the waist and she's got

knitting needles stuck in the hair that

sprouts up from between her horns and

you can see her face is sort of locked

into what you imagine is a perpetual

frown built on years of scowling

probably at young children and she has

tucked under her other arm what appears

to be a box with a clasp a long thin box

which you think might hold maybe a

musical instrument or something else

fairly small and portable

you're not exactly clear what and she

holds it very guardedly and protectively

and she watches the kids closely as they

survey the pies and she says one each no

more

um am i down there yet or no just no no

Steve Allen and evylyn you're you're

kind of torn between the distraction of

their arrival and these kids who are

talking loudly and pointing at pies and

saying I think there's worms in that one

and then and of course the letter that

you pull out which doesn't have a whole

lot of writing on it I think I like to

imagine that she had finally been like

okay I just have to rip off the band-aid

and I'm just gonna read it and she like

ripped open the envelope but right then

the bell rang and she was like phew

decision mate and she just stuffs it in

a pod without reading it and then goes

hello welcome to Chickenfoot coven pies

I'm even your associate what can I help

you with today my charges are hungry and

they require a pastry can you offer

something with a fair amount of

nutrition and decent taste oh yes I'll

get our past specialists tricks to tell

you the exact contents of each of these

pies momentarily she will be able to

provide you the most satisfactory pie

shopping experience

strannix and she goes walking out to

find Strix

okay all right so Strix you hear

evylyn screaming for you all right yeah

you come down having entrusted polios

care and well-being to your compatriot

palton as you come down the spiral

staircase into the bakery you see all

Coria she seems to be she seems to be

standing apart from the children and the

teeth Ling woman their caretaker who has

just come in the kids are talking loudly

and excitedly and they are trying to

claim to this tiefling woman they can

pick out their own pie and the tiefling

woman seems to be just listening to

their rambling with weary with a weary

scowl on her face when all Coria sees

you she walks over to you and says ah

good what something happened

hmm I'm sorry you could have to be more

specific

at which point at which point there's

probably some activity upstairs that

sort of catches her eye or her ear and

she says there is a good chance that a

member of the Baker's guild is going to

come by sometime today to see how

everything is going and possibly to sell

us and supplies eggs flour mm-hmm and

that kind of thing anyway I think that I

should be here to greet him and look

after him during his stay while you keep

Strix locked in the closet to make sure

she doesn't get out well I mean I'm not

gonna lock strips up you know what I

mean yes but yeah yeah this could be

very very beneficial like we do need a

good a fair amount of supplies

especially if we can get them at a bulk

price or something at the like exactly

you I these could be planning on

searching down here or the whole house

Oh we'll just keep them to the the

kitchen and the storage and the the

bakery itself they don't need to see the

end he won't want to see the entire

house no no great and then there's

probably well let's see what's going on

upstairs at this exact moment paltin so

like Walter as he says like you're just

gonna look around down here right you're

like something and like stuff falling

over and like muffled not screaming but

just like loud talking you just hear

like oh he's a feisty one a balton

shouting so this so this is the toilet

you know it's not good when maids just

smiling to himself just you know things

of the sort and all Coria cannot help

but cast your gaze upward through the

floor

we are dealing with an infestation oh I

thought all this one's squirming see

[Laughter]

well best to try to keep that under

wraps - absolutely any idea when the

Baker's guild but planner coming by

today he makes the round so it's hard to

say depends how long it takes him to get

past his previous appointments but I

expect him to be around sometime between

now and sundown so I could just make

myself comfortable and await his arrival

I've cleared my schedule yes you should

absolutely stay here for the arrival in

the meantime Strix is still our most

experienced Baker and our only

experienced Baker and she could we still

list her to help make sure that she can

make her finest pies and finest products

that we can hopefully impress the guild

I'm sure she will if someone can bring

some of that gunpowder that'd be dope

you hear squidly on it you want the gun

Jim and I will do my best to make sure

there are no distractions

all right you sort of back up the stairs

a little away and then turn and run up

the rest of the distance I have I been

able to find strikes to bring her down

nope yes you can grab her and haul her

down and encounter AB DF at the top of

the staircase so de Valence tricks

trying to make their way back downstairs

I love that whereas as a crew we're just

doing circles around each other it's a

comedy baby like an important person

shows up and each person like

individually takes all the others

accomplished something thanks though as

Dias bumps into a meal let them know

that you know there's a bigger skilled

person

the best possible pies and things

cleaned up and in order as much as

possible waffles in the children

contained strokes we need you in the

kitchen right away I'm right here did

they even find strikes like outside

where paltin is dealing with the

doppelganger and she kind of does one of

those like and just walks away from okay

yeah strikes is gonna first you gonna

leave Paulsen and be like make sure to

ask him how he cursed me so I can undo

it and then she'll go down the stairs

and go that's what that's what do you

see Oh Coria you see the tiefling woman

and you see the two children all

collected together all right oh my god I

was so busy yeah who who was first who

was first you can see that the young boy

the young girl have their eyes on

certain things they wanted and the

tiefling woman wants to know what's in

them oh all right

you know I'll go through each of them

and I'm like okay this one is is

raspberry and Blackberry that one's

lovely it's got some cinnamon in it too

this one is a orange cream pie I don't

even know what that tastes the whole

time this is going on you're sort of

darting eyes over Dell Coria and she's

just rolling her eyes like don't tell

him what every goddamn pie just selling

[Laughter]

before you kids the ones you want I'm

like holding them up yes they you can

see that the the girl picks hers out

immediately she likes she likes the way

that the the ends of the crusts all look

on the pastry the boy is much more

finicky and he psyche that one no no

that one no I don't like that one

anymore

I want that one each time I pull it out

and just get a little bit more

exasperated I'm like hey you can see you

can see the tiefling woman take a slight

perverse delight in your exasperation

like this sort of look on her face

saying this is what I deal with every

day so just cope I give her a look like

a girl I just like I get the pies up and

I'm you know like I'm told to accept

money for these

I look at the tiefling woman see I dig

she digs into a pocket of her kimono and

pulls out a small little pouch you can

see that there's a clasp around or a

little pin on the pouch with a emblem on

it that suggests like a family crest

may I investigate this you sure can

in fact just just make a perception

check because I think you've seen this

crest before okay that's a 13 you

recognize the crest from a bank that you

went to now how long ago it is it is the

crest of the Castle enter house got it

all right but she gives she gives you

the money she puts it down on the

counter and that she puts the little

pouch away then she uh sure's the kids

over to a table to eat and puts the box

down next to her and plops down in a

chair and basically takes a load off her

feet all right

I am curious but very scared so I'm just

going to ask them if they like any

drinks and just continue to serve

everyone in the kitchen and then also go

back to the or Koryo and as just kind of

like that the boy and the girl shout

coffee but the tea fling woman says milk

will be sufficient

just like my wonder why they wouldn't

want coffee and she'll go get some milk

but she'll she'll bring some coffee for

the tea plain woman okay hand it to her

and say this is on the house you'll be

as you're pouring the milk Albie who

sort of hangs out in the kitchen a lot

your little albino gazer beholder buddy

just sort of kind of drools into it okay

I mean the tea planes gonna be fine I

usually like if it's 40 planes like you

know they usually don't die if they're

accidentally like drooled on sober yeah

so I'll just I'll bring it out there

Albie can come with me - Albie likes to

follow sometimes it's okay and uh and ER

the coffee and give the kids the milk

and I'll make the milk nice like with

some honey and it'll be warm to calm

them down a little bit nice but when I

hand her the coffee you know I'll

definitely be like it seems like you've

had a rough day

so you know maybe uh maybe you'd like to

just uh you know relax a bit okay when

you turn around you can see Jenks has

appeared next to yous Strix and he's

he's holding this disemboweled

rag that used to be Ferdinand his

stuffed albear and you can see tears

welled up in the corners of his eyes as

he just sort of holds this rag up and

tells you that paltin and DF killed

Ferdinand yeah all right well I'm going

to pick it up and just sort of like look

at it sadly and be like ah hold one

second and I'll just like press two

digit 8 it to be cute again behind like

like hidden okay

oh yeah chance reminded me that I fixed

him already I submit our fireside

episode I'm sure okay but he's so he I

did the same thing so I fixed it and I

just give it back to him like here it is

it's cute again that's when Jenks

notices the two kids and you can see

that while they're eating their pie

they've unpacked the box which contains

a bunch of little figurines of knights

and monsters oh that's fun and they

start playing with them on the table

that's fine I like them can I make one

like move or something cool are you

talking about Jenks or Strix

Oh Strix yeah you wanted like sure to

try to cast like an illusion like a

minor illusion or something I don't have

minor illusion I guess I could animate

one of them you could um no animate one

of them cuz animate one of them and have

them just like right around be like like

it's alive wait okay at first they're

like missed they're like just amazed

that one of their figurines has come to

life and then they're completely

enthralled and happiest clams and they

start to laugh as this thing night or

whatever starts to basically prance

around on the tabletop nice hi wink at

the tea fling later I'm like they'll be

busy for a while the other kids can

probably make their way down to once

they start hearing oh my

there are other kids in this house and

I'm like Jenks look friends friends yeah

so Jenks just make a d20 roll for me

okay am I gonna stab me 12 okay that's

enough to basically kind of insinuate

himself into a sort of an instant bond

or friendship with these children and

play you know how children are right

you know they've you got two kids

playing with toys of a third wants to

come in sometimes they'll just bring em

in and other times they'll just cast

them out you never know quite why but in

this case they they seem to welcome

Jenks and Jenks hits it off with them

like that oh yeah and he's just like wow

I can make some of these move to what he

liked rent like it's like using subtle

yeah and suddenly all the dread and fear

that he's been feeling lately just sort

of wash away has the toys and that that

leaves us with squiggly and net like

squiggly runs down the stairs and like

sees the kids playing every good time

he's covered with like gunpowder or like

dust on his face he has like a cat

scratch it's like on a dripping blood

okay just like yeah he's actually

probably got like some of the some of

the powder has probably actually caught

fire because it does tend to combust but

being a tiefling he's like barely

noticing I absolutely go wash my hands I

[Laughter]

guess not that do you think that these

two new kids are about a year younger

than you probably they're actually is

about squigglies age you know I think

that is still a little bit shaken from

this whole like it wasn't so long ago

that she was about to stab somebody

mm-hmm

and she's feeling very grown-up so she

looks at these kids playing and she kind

of is like she goes and stands by doea

that attention all right d/f you see

palton dragging pluriel

it's like a weird can trap there's you

like tried to set it up there's like

trails of like gunpowder

all over the floor and like hooked up to

like ropes and it's just like you get

the idea that he wasn't really sure what

he was trying to do but you just like

walk any turns he's like oh hey it

wasn't ready but wants to play a game DF

will just look at paltin and back

towards Florio like he knows exactly

what he's doing as this is happening

there is an explosion behind paltin as

some of the smoke powder on the floor

combusts and it lasts simon through a

doorway

okay yeah you see simon asses over

elbows just sort of lying there amid

some other stuff in in in the in the

room and he just sorts he just kind of

sits up and you can see his his jester

hat has fallen off and it's just sort of

smoking between his legs I've like I

don't think I've ever seen Simon without

a hat hmm

so I'm initially just like oh that's oh

that's unsettling yeah you're like take

it just like dust it off I got the fire

out just he just kind of looks his eyes

cast up toward the Hat and then look

deep into you

you okay he doesn't respond he just he

just looks at you blankly he doesn't

have much expression and then he holds

up a thumb and then it's it's just sort

of like a fire that's smoking on the end

of it just does kind I'd like I'm just

kind of yeah all right he looks a little

black and thumb and then stands up well

let's let's get you let's get you let's

get you back to your room and let's not

you know have you near so many

explosions potential explosions

explosion yeah you you're looking at DF

when you turn back to Simon he seems to

be making his way downstairs to hear

what the ruckus is about that works yep

so it's just you DF and Laurie oh at

this point in time or not and that yes

cuz NAT is standing very close to dia

very like very adult and grown-up yep

Deus will actually turn to net and tell

her that I really need your help for

just a brief moment can you please make

sure that the other that your fellow

adventurers don't come up here for a

little bit and they just enjoy their

time downstairs and just make sure

they're good she walks off good almost

like a damn March yeah mm-hmm

and after that DF will go to pluriel

take the chair spin it and then this

will sit down on the chair kind of lean

forward on one arm is look straight at

the pleura and just say now you and I

both know you are not rag miss you are

not anything you say you are however you

are going to tell me everything that you

know

and as he's saying this yes takes out

moon splinter mmm-hmm cop plays the

blade on one tip of the finger and then

reaches down onto a sigh of his belt and

hops out a little bottle of poison that

he's been holding on to since Chilton

and then kind of sits that on his knee

right next to the knife okay and pluriel

is enough of a good mind reader to know

exactly what's in that vial and exactly

what moon splinter is yeah

to which I suppose

glory Oh we'll just say something along

the line along the lines of hey we both

know this would all be much easier if

you would just give us the stone then

then DF call like look up at him real

quick

without even replying plural than say oh

oh you were mistaken I mean III here I'm

in the room right yeah you're you're you

are the only only one present at the

moment say what stone catch me up yes

starts unscrewing the bottle they're

looking for the storm of galore one of

the key pieces of trying to open up

their way to the Dragon horde oh now who

are you trying to do this for - which

plural will respond with I suppose you

don't know but empty of your friends

already do hey all right

it's like check this out I'm gonna go

ahead and step in here and I'm gonna be

worse cop first thing I'm gonna do is

get all up in his face and yell at him

I'm gonna tell dia it's like first off

I'm gonna see if I can scare this guy

into giving us straight answers and not

play around and all

relieve you of having to RP talking to

yourself that sound good dude so I like

just grab them I'm like I listen here

you fake little if you don't give

us straight answers right now I'm gonna

start slapping you in places you don't

even know you had

lore'l actually got took takes his gaze

back over to dia and oh oh you hate that

don't you you don't like it when you

don't know something that the others do

doesn't feel good does it like let's see

here bud I barely pay attention at the

time so I probably don't know what

you're talking about

Lauri I'll take another point of damage

can I also try to intimidate him to stop

being so ominous sure cool

so that is a 25 all right that seems

pretty intimidating it's like I'm gonna

argue to that if he's a mind reader and

this is inspired by a hair Schlag son in

chat if he's a mind reader and he reads

Paulson's mind and palton is aware that

he's a character in a game that could

probably give someone a big existential

crisis yeah well I don't know if I want

to go down that route so I'm just gonna

gloss over that he's intimidated though

right oh yeah I was just like I've done

way worse to people for way less buddy I

killed a guy cuz he you know what I

don't even remember what he did

I guess plural it was turned back

towards Bolton he also kind of dressing

D at the same time is saying there's a

dog I've been watching for a long time

long before you returned of otter deep

heel actually looks at palton first a

brief moment says

your first mistake was not finishing

mnsure now this will never be over bones

like yet can't come here Ellison it's

like Manchu it sounds familiar

what's that idea that she just says I

don't know which plural quickly quickly

juts and says and that drives them crazy

I feel like it's like wait

I think I think it might be the guy on

the cover I think that's who I'm

thinking of okay Moulton turns back to

him and you just like some mansions the

problem then is what you're saying the

whole problem no no no

you've only been the problem the only

thing we need is the answers and if you

don't have it I bet you know who does I

can't speak for everyone but I don't

Torrio's eyes narrow damn it

all right downstairs Strix you've given

you're trying to have you handed out the

pies you've animated a little figure the

kids are like okay animate that one

enemy that wouldn't they're trying to

get you to animate a bunch of them I can

only do that once a while on but uh just

pointed so with your with your spell if

I remember correctly with small with

tiny objects you can ultimate you can

animate several so I think it's like

three at a time or something yeah she

was up to ten non magical objects

arranged that are not being worn or

carried medium targets count as two

large countess four huge is eight see

the Nana made up to ten of these little

figurines Oh fun I'm like oh I did not

know that

so all right they're all animated now

that seems that seems to captivate the

interest of everybody you can see Simon

kind of make his way over to see what's

going on over there I make some eyes at

him and I'm like I kind of mouth no

kidnapping no no take stick

oh well choreographed by the hair and

just sort of leans you down and says

could I have a word with you would

private dick what yes but you could ask

me oh shut up

come here oh yes ma'am she takes you she

takes you aside and casts her glance

back at the playing children and it's

Simon looking at them and saying why

haven't you done anything about him yet

what the what Simon yes your little

puppet boy I mean he's not my

responsibility

it's he's his parents responsibility oh

no he's not your responsibility

no I beg to differ he lives under your

roof - our roof it's your roof way more

than mine that's correct

either Magnus's roof technically and she

says you have the ability why don't you

turn him into a real boy wait do I you

rack your brain okay make a intelligence

Arcana I'm just like sitting there like

cool on record scratch beat that's an 18

okay this not sure why it hadn't

occurred to you before but a polymorph

spell can turn one creature into another

type of creature and a construct is a

creature and a boy is a creature there's

nothing stopping you from turning Simon

into a real boy the spell the problem is

is that it's not permanent it's only for

two or an hour right like ethical

reasons I wouldn't do this

she says don't you think he would like

to try to be a real boy if only for a

short time I mean ma'am I'd like to ask

him I don't like making decisions for

people of course and you can also ask

him this or tell him this if he likes it

tell him I can cast true collie morph

and make it permanent I mean that's a

very different spell all these teach me

that spell can you teach me that spell

please nobody else hears this except

strings but like MIT man interrogation

he's just like something's wrong no it's

that well strikes is like I yeah I can

do that uh leaving him in that

broken-down puppet form seems like a

awfully cruel thing to do honestly but

he frightens me every day and reminds me

of a bad time in my life so that sounds

great

so shoujo uh also say thank you just

like thanks for believing in my magic of

course yes I am a firm believer in your

magic and and in Jencks magic - I think

he'll be a good wizard one day you think

he really has magic because I sometimes

I just think he sees things and might be

crazy I think he has tremendous magic oh

how can I help him I want to help him

well were you helped by someone yes but

I don't want him to have that kind of

help I could find a friend of mine

perhaps who could tutor him well I could

shooter him maybe I'm just yes you could

but I could find a friend who could

tutor him better that's probably fair

plus I was tutored by Baba Yaga who I

think is evil he seems more inclined

toward wizardry than sorcery anyway I

see like you see her like feelings get

kind of hurt for a second like you're

right

I think he'd be a better wizard which

I'm not a wizard no you're not that's

right I'm gonna go folly more excitement

[Laughter]

sososo paltin you do feel the

disturbance in the force as if NPCs were

talking behind your back about things

that concern you yes I'll go up to Simon

say like hey Simon hey attention you get

his attention he's somewhat distracted

by the the animated toys and the fun

that the kids are having Simon I have a

proposal for you listen would you like

to be a real person boy I don't know how

old you are I mean it's this is

complicated because you live for 80

years to be whatever okay would you like

to be a real person for a while and then

if you like it would you like to be a

real person forever you see he was

voluntarily extracted and then he looks

right at you and his mouth just sort of

hangs open now I have one rule about

this please please but for the love of

everything just don't make any jokes

just not one just just I mean not like

not like no jokes just no like

knock-knock joke sir so you know like

overdone jokes at least not in

succession at least occasionally stop

for a couple hours that as I could all

right okay I don't I don't believe you

but I'm gonna do it anyway just

polymorph him into I guess a human boy

well as you cast the spell there's a as

pollen comes it's like kool-aid man's

through a wall you see you see magical

energy and motes of light swirl around

Simon in front of you palton as is woody

flesh disappears and is transformed into

actual flesh and he becomes before your

eyes

a cute little dark-haired boy with a

ridiculous costume on did evylyn see

this happen to

yes did she hear the real boy talker I

assumed she was kind of distracted with

a customer you know I'll Coria had taken

Strix to the side to have that

conversation privately so literally she

didn't hear anything until strict

started casting the spell okay

so evil and just turns around to at the

same time I probably been so so does

everybody else

the kids who are playing or wondering

what Strix is what Trix Trix is doing

next and that's when you see Simon real

boy standing before her Paul is just

kind of between strips so I'm just like

what what what why why why what

interrogation do that Polly's put a

large pin and put the biggest pin you

can find in this I have I I'll be back

don't talk to don't leave talk to Simon

first I don't you talk you're his father

but but does he talk this deep will be

fine he'll stab him it's fine just talk

to him

Bolton it's okay I asked for this you

like being like this I think that you're

fine the way you were but if you like

being like this you can be like this

well however you want to be is just fine

I've only been like this for like six

seconds right and how is it feeling

pretty good then he sticks his finger up

his nose and starts picking his nose

that's good yeah that's alright yeah

you've got bits in there ah

Simon did you ever get to eat a pie he

pokes lookbooks his finger out and looks

at it and then looks up at you and says

no Strix yes wow I'm in the best pie

strict society looks at the cricket pie

and she's like which one would you like

Simon I want that one and that one did

that one and that one I want to try them

all all right Strix is now kept

extremely busy taking slices of pie from

every play in the entire kitchen for

Simon evil ins like kind of patting his

head

he eats pie and she looks at Paulson and

she's like if you need to finish that

I'll I'll keep them busy eating pies

until you're done okay we'll definitely

be able to focus going back up there for

sure I also need a band-aid for my burnt

thumb okay how did you burn your thumb

yeah how come that wasn't fixed oh you

have a poop let me fix it even goes and

kisses it and lays on fleas on mommy

kiss all right the burn disappears okay

this is under as much control as it can

be I'm gonna go back upstairs things

have been quiet up there that's good no

barge back into the room it's like

alright I am back what did I miss

I swear to God if he's dead already

Laurie oh is already dead

alright you know what there's a thing

that came up so I'm just gonna get back

to that yeah you see it you see a

somewhat familiar grayish alien body

that's all that seems to be all that's

left at pluriel India is sitting there

just like wiping the remaining poison

off a moon splinter

Paul like when he walks back and he's

just like alright sorry about that I'm

back and he's dead you know for the sake

of story are real playing do you want to

see the moments of with death implore

you or we'd rather keep that if you have

them let's see I'll do it do it do it

alright Talton goes downstairs and from

just downstairs dear just hears multiple

people going DF continues like prepping

the poison - which plural we'll say

something along the lines of C we

thought it would be here I'll account to

you she was just here but I guess we

were looking in the wrong place you gave

it to her to sneak up to

deaath has fished applying the poison at

this point and says no we did not in

fact I had no idea she was even looking

for something like this I had my

suspicions but thanks to you you just

confirmed them funny how these

interrogations work ploy ill will then

say I know you like to think you're

clever but the more we watch you the

more we study we know you boy

and better than you ever riddle would

you like to know what she was thinking

when I saw her face yes does not look up

atom and pleura is cool there it is I

knew there was rage saw more deep inside

of you it's too bad yes we both know

you're not a killer

Dodd twitch DF will say no I do defend

and protect the ones I love and then

it'll just press moon splinter into them

twist it let go and just sit there and

let the poison take its effect and then

as soon as the poison is over he just

focuses and let's move splinter reappear

in his hand and then Poulter comes back

yes do great so he's dead ah did we get

what we needed out of him as much as I

can did he tell you more about D&D vanos

what never mind I just I you know I

counter spelled that wizard and I was

kind of unaware of who was who and then

you know I had a lot of people telling

me dude that was crazy when you did die

he's gonna kill you I'm just like well

this isn't happening in game so it

doesn't really apply but that sounds

like manchu and then he had mentioned

him yeah that's the one leader this

targum Oh which means they too are after

of the dragon heart

they came here thinking that I had the

stone of calor I don't but we know who

does thanks to him as he explains who he

is like Paulo just piecing everything

together like oh oh I like you both to

make perception checks montine how much

21:13 ok paltin you don't hear it but DF

you do it is the sound of flapping

little wings downstairs the teeth

wingwoman sort of starts to put the

figurines back in the box and says well

I think we're done here

kids we have to leave back home

we go and you see her put the toys away

and the kids are like oh and you know

Jenks is sad to see his new friends go

but they they turn to you Jenks and you

know their names are Terenzi oh and elds

arena and they say that you know we can

come back any time and we'll play some

more and we'll bring our toys and we'll

bring other toys or you come to our

house and we can have fun there we have

a big house not too far away from here

and we could play in our yard and my

mother has a butterfly garden oh oh jinx

jinx is coming really that sounds

awesome I love I love big places of

butterflies and magic figs you have

magic at your place now Serena says

we're filthy rich I don't know what that

beads we have all the money you could

imagine but do you have magic they look

at each other and says we do if you're

our friend all right

I could be your wizard that sounds cool

and you can see the tiefling is trying

to usher them out as quickly as possible

meanwhile Simon is like granny Strix yes

Simon then he says I might granny why am

I always whatever you know among hags

Granny Smith is granny is quite an

honorific uh that just makes it worse

okay she she's just like yes Simon yes I

you can call me great uh you can see

he's he's crammed much pie into his pie

hole and I don't feel so well oh did you

eat too much pie no he is he should get

as much as he wants he's been deprived

of pie his whole life he should have

every little sweet thing he wants do you

want to exercise Simon exercises I'm not

no like eating the pie you stopped

eating the pie okay so I'm ready to go

get yourself some milk from yeah he lets

out a very large belch face that you can

fill to eat things so you have to go

gets me to drink and then if you again

if you like being like this you're only

like this for an hour and you have to

ask if you want to be like this mostly

forever I think I have to pee okay

that's that's not I'm I remember the

first time I had to pee after I was a

construct it felt so good out here I'll

show you where the bathroom is it's the

Privy he stands up and he stops and he's

like looking down his pants whoa come on

honey I'll get you cleaned up okay

he makes the swept stairs fondling

himself and she's just completely not oh

yeah it's totally different when your

human body and things are all soft and

weird and

like come out everywhere you walk

upstairs palton is like dragging a body

and then he sees you and then he just

sort of drags it back in hides it behind

the door so Strix is downstairs alone

now yeah well more or less yeah you can

see that except for Cory Oh Oh Cory is

just potty training Simon don't worry

okay that's definitely way more

interesting and more weird than what

we're dealing with here I'm sorry that

you're missing these beautiful

milestones at our son's life but don't

worry I have it handled Trix is gonna go

down cor hope you like could you curse

someone by touching their face no I'm

very confused then and well then I must

be cursed forever must be not a curse

you know what I bet mmm

poison maybe your employees will touch

each other all the time do they yes

policy there's a weird episodes just

like I'll consider that walks away okay

yeah and UCL Cory is just sitting in a

chair probably that cursed rod or the

strut on chair of its chair for lack of

a more comfortable chair and then you

can see that the the tiefling woman and

that show and the two kids have left

leaving squiggly Jenks net and their

friends behind that is noticeably not

playing she's very much like supervising

yeah you take Simon evil into a privy

and he just has a good time woo peeing

all over everything there's a really

weird episode uh yes all the years I had

teaching little children it's been so

long this is wonderful

it goes in the hole why because that's

where we put pan backs districts and

going really if I do this to your face

it's not gonna curse you just like try

to touch your face she stopped that's

the second time so what stopped me today

don't be childish

yeth we'll probably having come

downstairs mm-hmm

I do with this get rid of it just you

just left just leaving me with it

you seem like you got it handled yeah

looks at the window he's like all right

[Laughter]

okay she'll go up to NAT and like like a

firm grip on the shoulder net be like

well done some people are walking by

Trost go Ali I don't know who they are

or what brings up friends of the city

but they just catch a glimpse at the

corner of the eye of this torso being

jammed out of a window anyway that says

nut says thank you I didn't play

but feel free to play as well you don't

play I'm different why I want to be just

like you ah yeah brave and I protect I

don't play

I'm not a baby

well I'll tell you about it soon when

you're just a little older she looks

miffed at that because she wants to be

considered a grown-up it's kind of like

but she doesn't ever contradict yet yeah

evil and I finish good job let's go tell

aunty Strix everything maybe we could

train hand ro to do that do what after

he says he's finished you're squidly

he's just like the new kid peed on me

hey what are you doing in there get out

of there I'm gonna eat them did we miss

the point part where someone from the

Baker's guild is coming by please clean

granny oh my god

uncle no stupid you're stupid

suddenly the Strix and Simon are

fighting Simon I'm sorry yes that goes

on yes just frantically trying to press

to digitate the pee off of everything in

the bathroom yes squid squid leaves just

like I'm from the streets I'm nine years

old I got it up on you age-wise he's

right that's why he calls me granny I

guess I don't know I I'm having an

identity crisis I shake someone stop

hitting your elders kick kick kick

I'm your uncle I'm your elder

I just leave as soon as it's clean I

leave I'm like I can't and this is

completely silently completely

dissociated from everything else just

trying to like figure out the books and

get things prepared and cleaned up and

tied it up for people coming by while

this nonsense is going around in every

floor even sees death like that and

she's like I know we talked about the

kids being more responsible and doing

more chores but this is simon's only

hour so far as real human I wanted to

feel what it's really like to see if he

likes it if I saw darts of my mouth

you'd be out look at him

playing so well with me if I knew how to

use a gun I'd mess you up

meanwhile Pelton's just like yeah I

don't worry I'm fine up here as he's

like that's right I'll literally

literally four minutes later squidly and

Simon are on the roof firing a gun

together no I think I think you like

lady no that's just too much powder too

too much powder no it's fine that's yeah

you're gonna blow off half the roof

welcome to D&D the parenting Simon

Simon's trying to tow squiddly how to

use a gun he's like I'll push you I'll

push you off this roof no one would know

no you wouldn't dare

you get into so much trouble they would

they would they would send you back to

the docks

ah you take that back no she she doesn't

want to get in the way of their playtime

she also doesn't want them to actually

shoot each other with a gun so I didn't

she's kind of hovering off to the side

like let the boys have their fun but she

I yeah and she's still got that letter

burning a hole in her pocket mm-hmm it's

a seven

it's just though this is just opposed

basically strength of lecture so he's

got to just make a role as well all

right you try to push him off and he is

just barely able to resist you because

he rolled a 9 hmm so you push him off

and and you you see he just sort of

grabs hold of you and prevents you from

going over without also taking pushing

yourself off yeah but I need you to make

another d20 role okay that's a six the

gun goes sliding out of your hand amidst

the tussle and basically slides down the

roof shingles threatening to basically

go over the edge and crash down upon the

cobblestones it's like it's like going

down and hitting stuff into that thing

where every time it's like exactly yeah

uh I think when evylyn sees this

happening she will maybe go go catch the

gun and be like I think it's time maybe

we put this toy away just make a

dexterity check to catch the gun nein

okay it's it you don't quite get to it

in time it you reach for it you miss it

by mere inches and it falls and crashes

and explodes on the pavement and

everybody everybody inside here's this

crack sound outside this report as the

gun as the smoke powder in the gun

explodes destroying the weapon by chance

if by chance did it fall off the side of

the house where maybe it's still window

palmas you do it's actually just Falls

right past you and then explode what the

hell

even here's the what the hell and she's

like okay kids time to just go back

inside lets you know tiptoe tiptoe

chuffing assuring them back inside

Simon Says the squiggly pollens gonna

end you now if I tell me you did it oh

you wouldn't dare

I would you won't believe you he's known

me longer sweetly like kind of leans in

it's just like what looks like looks as

in how far how far is even from them

Oh like right now 15 10 15 feet it's

like alright hear me out what if we say

she did it okay okay yeah okay

Paulding won't do anything to her he's

gone he's like crazy in love with her

like and yes I don't really know what

that means but okay well when you're a

little bit older like I am you'll know

all about love what's that about love my

son I love you too come on let's go

outside okay yeah yeah the body goes out

the window

lands very awkwardly see you didn't

think about it you didn't think a body

could bend that way but this body this

body's done exactly that what are we

doing and like it like gets in this

weird landscape yeah in the in the

explosion of God and Paul's just like

there's a really weird episode all right

Ivy let evil and you've led the boys

back inside they look like they might be

in some trouble Paul and Paul and walks

out finds them cool throw my gun off the

roof no one threw it it was evylyn she

did Simon she looks at them with this

look of like curse you and your sudden

but inevitable betrayal

[Laughter]

I'm wondering if I believe it I doubt it

I doubt it no evens like regardless no

one should have been able to find the

gun because it should have been secured

away from anyone who might want to play

with it

shouldn't it palms like are you are you

trying to put this on me I'm not saying

it's anyone's fault you're the one who

threw it off the roof look at these kids

would they lie if it looks like paltin

like what game are we playing all this

oh yeah this is all shared knowledge

what do I need to do you want to stay a

real boy or not Simon and if you want to

save your boy you can't lie to people or

steal guns or be bean why well you lie

to people and you're mean all the time

anyone squiggly like Oh what lies at my

side Simon he says well you lie about

your true feelings about DF I'm sorry oh

whoa I think dude I think we know Wow

side of you you have so many years of

just watching I don't think he should be

I don't think you should be a real boy I

think I think he should I think we

should just he should be gone I like him

Simon what else do you know you seem to

have a lot of ideas about what you've

seen over these many years okay you know

what I'm gonna watch I walk away I want

school is like fiction would you like

some more pie how about you stuff some

more player balls good school he points

at Pauling goes he knows that that one

likes you sounds like oh oh no it's they

both gotta go now

he's just like i am.i this is to

metaphor me i just called myself out in

a way i can i just start like scooting

squiggly off as i go right now i'm

exactly yeah what are you waiting for it

Todd

look we all like each other very much in

this house we all love each other very

much we are one big family and that is

not weird or funny it's just how we all

live yeah Simon also todd todd is our

friend and we love him too this is just

a huge mess maybe it's time that

everyone took a nap there Rob you know

there wasn't there was a subconscious

reason why I didn't turn Simon drew a

real boy when I was there for 50 years

probably because of this oh maybe you

should have done something else along

with it like ask the parents I mean I

was told by my age teacher lady who

Simon starts the yawn it says you know I

I am kind of feeling tired which is

weird

not weird very much I think I think we

should go upstairs and have a nap and

then he winks at squidly Wow

I mean are you sure that's how you want

to spend the rest of your hour as I'm in

just an hour just one hour just then

that's all its ever gonna be

okay well Coria says I can make it

permanent mmm you sad that sits let's

now calm it down really quick hey hey if

someone wants to be human then he should

be given that choice but Simon you

should know that we love you just the

way you are and you're out of a human

she wasn't done she didn't have to

finish because I knew what she was going

to say I want to be human even looks at

palton like

dude I don't even know how to be funny

about this I got nothing when I was a

construct wouldn't you have wanted me to

be able to choose to be human again yes

he should be human but Simon you should

not assume things about your friends /

family yeah your grandmother's feelings

are hers for her to keep I just do you

promise Simon okay all right I still

don't believe you

there's let it be hope human whatever

it's fine I can't do that magic cuz I'm

not good enough at magic to do that but

she can remember when in dis remember

when he was trying to kill us

that was that was that was oh it has it

been a minute when Simon was trying to

kill us

yeah oh man those memories how things

have changed how far we've come

alright perma boy the boy I will need to

concentrate on the spell for an hour but

I don't have to be in his presence to do

so after the casting well if you're

tired Simon then sleep feels real nice

maybe you should just go to sleep

just the spell and you'll wake up like

this forever absolutely they if the if

the member of the Baker's guild comes

while I'm concentrating on this spell

someone else is going to have to deal

with him nose goes cut to member of the

Baker's guild standing outside looking

at a broken body that's been pushed out

the window of the Waffle House it's not

inside and you know I got they have they

knocked on the door yet are they just

outside would you

[Laughter]

hi I would have questions called the big

mess I know there is no knock on the

door but I'll Coria does begin the

casting of the spell and when she's

complete you can see her with great

concentration just sort of sit quietly

in a corner I'm I don't know how Wizards

work so I'm just like shouldn't you have

a book not there books for this I don't

know I just do magic by the grace I do

have a book yes but I don't carry it

around because it is so big Wow damn

that's really just flexed on you

everyone's being mean districts today so

she's just gonna go outside and just sit

on the stoop you know that's what I'm

gonna do I'm just gonna go outside and

sit on the stoop Oh God Mother's Day and

I go Salus nope

the shadow of several guards falls upon

you Strix as you are sitting out on the

stoop and one of them politely asks why

there is a dead body lying right side

your reference and I look at it and I go

that's and they don't know what it is

exactly so if you have any information

about that they would appreciate that

yeah I go that's a doppelganger it was

in the service of the the zetz because

they were trying to murder all of us but

did it exasperation trying to get into

your house I look at him and I'm like no

miss or no cuz it looks like it was

dropped from your third-floor window

looks like he's dropped like four times

I don't know how this creature perished

but they are evil and we are in one of

the guards holds up as sort of chives is

it well actually I think the kind of

neutral but whatever but anyway

you see here you see the guards to say

so did how did he die

it died I have no idea I mean it fell

from the roof so clearly it died from

partially that okay so your official

statement then is while breaking into

your house it slipped and fell off your

roof died yeah I guess I yes they also

turn and look at each other and says oh

no gunpowder and sweep it up I'll make

it happen captain

Rick's is still standing in front of him

with a new hat that says captain what

much faster that I thought they was

going to I was ready take the Hat

sweeping up gum calories like weird

weird episode even as she you know she's

made sure the children are kind of like

playing peacefully asked not to keep an

eye on them going around straightening

things and decorations but then as soon

as she finds herself kind of a loan for

a moment she is gonna pull out that that

letter and see what it says your brother

very succinctly tells you that he has

been named sheriff of M fail

does this surprise me kind of in a way

that you never sort of expected your

brother to become sort of a political

kind of figure yeah cuz he was like part

of this lordly family but I thought he'd

just kind of sit in the lap of that

luxury and let other people run things

exactly so you're you're a little

surprised that he would take on this

responsibility but the tone of the

letter suggests that he's he's proud of

this opportunity and maybe kind of

rubbing your nose a little bit in it

you're not sure it's it's a little hard

to read between the lines with him

because it is so it is so six inked

there is none of the usual sort of hey

how you doing hope all's going well in

the church and blah blah blah blah blah

and you know enjoy life inspires in the

morning everything going smoothly

nothing like that he just tells you hey

I got this new job I'm the sheriff of M

fail and you know that's it hmm she

reads it like three times trying to read

between the lines yep

and when she's coming you could pick an

insight check to see if you can discern

anything else in the letter he was named

sheriff of what my hometown and fail M

Phil which is a town north of Waterdeep

oh do you smell that

a mph al a IO and okay yep in sight 10

okay so there's a mention in there that

all that that the noble the controlling

noble families of the town basically all

agreed to put him in the position and

you know that that's basically the the

ill Zimmer's the roaring horns and the

am Catherine with whom you've had some

other dealings and you know that as a

Marth Ain he would he would be a natural

choice to elevate to such a position

because the Marth Ain family is held in

such high regard still you think that

this is you get the impression based on

the writing with your ten that there

must be some other reason other than

just being able to call himself Sheriff

and hold position that would attract

your brother to it you just know you

just don't know what it was you think

he's got something hatching mmm-hmm when

you say I think he's got something

hatching like there's something else

yeah something else there he his his

motives are not clear to you because as

you say he was a type who just wanted to

kind of live with the money and enjoy

you know horse riding and basically a

 you attitude to the world and I

think he I think it might be to impress

somebody interesting cool and I think he

was always a little bit grudging of

having to kind of like hold all of the

family holdings after the parents died

and she left and everything so it's

really weird that she's like why would

you take on more responsibility when you

used to complain that you had to do

everything yourself after I left some

interesting okay well that that just

kind of sits and she kind of looks at

this letter a few times trying to figure

out why he would tell her this right you

don't remember the last time he wrote

you with any real information about what

he was doing in his life

no in fact I don't think she's even

heard from him since she he wrote to say

that their mother had died maybe she got

some like basic news from like the

household but not for him yes yeah

exactly

okay

yeah she tucks it back in her pocket and

continues making everything Instagram

filter perfect okay Simon has a well

while this kids are off doing their own

thing Simon actually has a conversation

with NAT and squidly and jinx too and

basically says so now you guys have sort

of been hanging around here and he kind

of says it in a way like you guys are

just hanging around taking up space he

says what are you going to do I mean you

can't stay here forever squigglies just

like what now it's like why not have you

ever thought about maybe forming your

own adventure 'party we are an

adventuring party yeah but you're not

gonna find any adventures here you're

just gonna find the same tired ooh

I love her but I can't talk to her I

love him but I can't talk to him I don't

know man were you here when those

assassins came up from the basement

that's pretty pretty adventury anyway

[Laughter]

well this is this is a danger location

for sure and maybe you'd be safer

somewhere else

we don't need safe we're adventurers uh

prove it I mean I I don't feel safe here

a lot my albear died maybe very sad I

mean it's cool I mean let's get serious

you have a you have a crappy wooden

sword you have a bow that fires like 20

feet and no but also gunpowder

you have a wand that you could poke

somebody in the eye with I suppose but

I've never seen any magic come out of it

so maybe we should learn how to like you

know be a real adventurers I want to be

a real adventurer Yeah right

I do I think I know magic I've seen it I

mean maybe strix did it but it could be

by when he says that you have only a

crappy wooden sword not slowly pulls out

the dagger and tries to look cool

all real dagger holy that doesn't

impress your friends puts it away and

she's like I'm a real adventurer ask

deaath does something about what do you

think makes a real adventurer well I

came from borough via what's that though

they haven't told you about borough via

they might have I don't really listen

well thanks told me but it she just

screamed for most of it have I got some

stories for you guys whoa

Swilly to sit down cross-legged he

begins to recount his experience and

growing up as it were in borough in the

swamps of morovia with granny Strix

while her friends were all dead and

waiting to be brought back to life it is

a it is a horrid disturbing tale which

you enjoy thoroughly all the kids are

like yes and he says and that's what

adventuring is all about I don't want to

do that it's magic there and then and

then there was the land of cult with

dinosaurs and zombies and horrible

horrible pirates and hags I can tell you

all about that

yes do it's like I don't know what any

of those are this sounds super magic

yeah jinks will now sit down next to

squidly and start listening to alright

and then as he's telling you this story

and the day is wearing in tonight and

you've been listed hanging on his words

and listening to the the waffle crews

exploits and then Simon's unique

insights into their behaviors and why

they can't seem to talk to each other

he suddenly realized he's very very

hungry and I'm gonna sneak down and get

some food do you want any okay I'll get

it I can get it you you keep you stayed

story I'll bring I'll bring pie that's

food there why don't we go there and get

something cuz I don't want to just eat

pie for the rest of my Oh

prepared dishes at the time at this

point sundown has come and gone and

there's no sign of the member of the

Baker's guild hmmm paltin walks out from

from cleaning the Gunpowder and he's

just like covered in just like black

soot and seized yet he goes I don't know

how it happened but there's more

gunpowder now at that point in time you

good in here now yeah it smells amazing

evylyn will try to help put palton out

and lay on hands as she does like yeah

there's a zoom Paul just doing another

bit yep hilarious when I'm on fire I

don't think that I don't think they're

coming d/f I don't think my pies are

good enough is it is the ladies still

there casting the spell at this one time

she's probably done casting the spell

but she'll linger for a little bit just

to make sure that they the Baker's guild

fella doesn't show up late but then you

can see even she's like okay I'm done

yeah Ethel watch her like Oh what

creepy robot sunny was not crazy or

long-suffering robot son mm-hmm he was

and is a good boy into a human because

he was always a real boy yes el correo

will come over to simon and says there

was no trouble at all my pleasure to

help I'm glad we could make it permanent

now you can live out your life your

short little human life and then she

walks away backhanded but you know she's

started very silence like what how long

do you miss live oh sub century life

expectancy like how long do how long do

constructs live yes technically could

live forever oh oh we need to teach our

son about mortality yeah there was some

fine print to that spell but yeah so you

don't last forever because we all slowly

degrade unless you made yourself ink up

one Jesus what yeah yeah he says now uh

when I grow up I want to be a bard Simon

do you eat just like daddy do you think

I want to soon it's like what makes you

wanna do that

because I think you're awesome and I

want to be like you and I think I think

I think I have talent and I think I can

entertain people and make them huh

what do you like to play Simon or if not

happy at least distract them from the

woes of their daily wretched lives

oh we do that every Tuesday I know and

he hugs you oh I don't care if you're

pandering or lying to me I like I don't

know I mean I spent 50 years with

anybody it's not nice to me and then as

he's hugging paltin the rest of you can

sort of see in Simon's eyes a look of

someone much older than he appears

there are machinations behind those

glossy blue eyes of his and he relaxes

in Paul Tain's

embrace but you can see he's thinking

about other things

evylyn assumes that he's planning a

surprise party for everyone as a

thank-you that must be it yeah yeah I'm

sure that's it and that's where we'll

stop he's like scooting Paul or he's

doing Simon upstairs it's like come on

fourth wall I never really got that yeah
