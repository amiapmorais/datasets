my god I am Tycho Brahe hey of Penny

Arcade impacts I am also a minister word

run CEO of acquisitions incorporated but

today Jared K hor Kim's and I am running

episode four indeed today's final

episode of waffles incorporated I hope

you have enjoyed yourself thoroughly a

few items before we get started our new

friends our new friends actually you

know what here I'll do the thing and

then I'll bring it back to my ripe

emerging is though from a mister out

indeed no confirmed by a mister it's all

around him

that's the thruster out of everybody

he's getting wild we have a Strix in the

mix a twist of trash which Oh back at it

back out again obviously a longtime ally

not only rarely summoned via an infernal

contract these days these days to my

left not your grandma's grandma except

in those rare cases where she is your

grandma's grandma Rosie bee stingers

yeah I want my staff cestus exactly and

dirty Deus that's around the corner

keeping it real keen that we can go into

that nest conde nast as we go through

here now what I suggested before is that

obviously when we play with our new

friends in a/c team style game of course

bits can result it's like we said before

the cameras came on I want you to

prepare yourselves waffle crew for your

first fun game of Dungeons & back enjoy

yourself here ready

yeah it's rich cream yeah it's a great

line

then you say wow you exclaimed it no no

no no I'm just I said it this time but

have fun

she's right so heretofore so forth and

so on what this means for our new

friends is that Holly Conrad aka Strix

has the trash which capability which she

can leverage to incorporate filth and

nastiness in the surrounding area to

bolster the damage of spells Oh our good

good boy dear boy

he has inner reserve so unlike

absolutely every other person who has

these abilities in this game he can use

his ability on other people's turns but

it is required that he described how he

protects them from damage Oh

in a clever way so he has a very very

novel mechanism and I know for a fact

because we've played together before

that he will leverage this information

with maximum cleverness I throw a boot

in front of them no but I got big booty

a boot like this certification

that's two charges to do that's two

charges to do that no of course you can

use a single one for to get it to grab

an advantage if you look at it

so when last we saw our heroes it's been

a it's been a while

you know you had some time there but do

you remember what happened because I

didn't watch it I was over watch things

on and so no I know exactly what

happened your chunk essentially a kind

of water Davian diorama was snatched out

of Waterdeep placed into a misty context

and there was a lot of fear and terror

as I recall because the game was being

run by Christmas certainly I like yeah I

mean I'm down with the horror as well

I'm an enthusiast by the same token

things might go a little bit differently

because

Chris and I have different things that

we need to accomplish in our final games

in ours we get to level up three times

that's right you guys you guys have to

level up to rescue the other no that's

not how Chris would never allowable so

and we are working together this is a

collabo much as one has on deviantART so

as I suggested you have been warped in a

kind of dollhouse scenario and a lot of

damage you only just got this house we

did and it is sustained damage that

insurance will not will not authorize

what we have insurance for ones that

don't know Magnus mad you know you don't

have demi plain of dread insurance no

standard because it's not offers a high

premium yo look at my goodness gracious

acts of God and or sentient claims no so

you are even now looking out the window

out into a wall of in which the

occasional strange light dances what do

you do the unseen servants are fixing

the house I think they're doing their

best and occasionally they bump into one

another and the work last to begin anew

well the mercy killers are gone friend

okay so Strix will lie on the ground and

just have a panic attack for a little

while

yeah just absorb as much terror yeah and

her surroundings as possible yeah she's

just gonna have a moment on the ground

to herself and also let waffles out of

her mist jar so waffles will recap Oreo

late arias in her room absolutely you're

not leveraging this massive friendly owl

bear for comfort purposes um I mean I'm

pretty sure if she sees Strix crying

she's used to it

yeah she'll probably just come and go

like what curl curl up around Strix

while she's crying yeah the the scenario

as I see it is that you are seized up or

around the midsection in a soft arm and

waffles proceeds to scoot and hoot

around the house scoot around the house

and you you are draped in this sort of

Hulk embrace yeah well while waffles

does the things that waffles needs to do

you're welcome to be as sad as you want

yeah she's just crying and waffles is

just like like cleaning her bits and

like just like I mean classics Trix

continents that you know you do it's

like if you want to if you want to keep

your Strix for a while mm-hmm you got to

do this kind of sense true yeah yes

you mentioned that you might know

something about burrow BIA because of

the Bustani rituals right so what do you

know well that's a good question

so how much or would I have encountered

in trying to research these rings I

assumed that like this is the seep of a

lot of this a lot of this business

indeed gather the vest Ani people are

sort of inextricable from these mists

but the books that your father had but

generally speaking entrance to or

escaped from Ravenloft tends to occur

within its desires and so there is much

about the about Ravenloft

burrow via the deme plane of dread that

is itself and obviously on-brand

shrouded yeah so we don't know then I

would ask the two of you you know that

you rat a kind of mystical crossroads

but signposts are hard to come by right

I would ask you've been here before yeah

what does this plane want from you

this place has almost a sense of

consciousness where if it takes someone

here is because it wants that person to

do or accomplish something or be used

for some purpose previously we were here

to defeat and destroy the vampire straud

and we're able to use that thanks to

help to some Bustani to

skip the realm and then upon returning

again again a different same place

different time essentially prevent the

wedding that made strawed what he is hmm

and upon accomplishment of both of those

we were able to I say accomplishment

with asterisks and air quotes and with

that we able to escape so a free of here

it needs us for something either for the

benefit the realm or because some other

thing wishes a way to use us against it

I'm not sure

hmm how do we find this out we just do

it I think we we can do is do what this

plane wants and then maybe live here if

it doesn't work yeah I know you don't

want to do that as I'm being like

dragged off you wave no now you don't

want to do that you can put me down

waffles I'm done crying voice is getting

quieter and you're being dragged around

I really want to be put down no please

put me down Strix has done it before and

I made an eternal vow that I would never

make her do it again okay that's good so

from here I mean we do know some people

we have some contacts we could try to

reach out to them maybe find them get a

sense of where we are within borough BIA

first and maybe from there we can get

partner assistance figure out when we

are and what new dire thing they're

dealing with have they needed assistance

with and maybe we can't we got to leave

the house to do that yeah yeah and it's

pretty spooky out there and I'm kind of

I'm going down the stairs it's bad you

just always in on the spooks or yeah

he's really hopeful to see a ghost or

these days oh you know you know what

this will this will be like a treat for

him oh yeah good not a ghost more just

always more a one Gus is never

this guy like Pringles also wearing your

ring right let me think I guess I am

wearing it that is correct

yeah it's not it's no longer and my

father's study knife okay it's been

extracted mmm I am wearing it I mean

it's on there so keep in mind that that

improves your AC right and also makes

you a target oh yeah oh yeah that's what

we're hoping for

it's great then I can just feel like

more of these Jesus kept by him Strix

will walk in after having done around

with waffles and it's like shaking the

fur off yeah

Shareen it's in great Tufts yeah should

we leave her here and come back for her

and Simon yeah do you think let me see

if isn't the manor I think they'll be

safest in the manor right I don't think

that we should bring them out there they

agree dance will turn to Simon I would

go down one mean like hand on the

shoulder like a like just talking to his

like Simon take care of waffles now just

do it for evylyn not for me you don't

care about me but do it for evil in a

few gentle pets of the leg and a head

tilt Yeah right Strix who do we know in

bravia yeah I mean we know a lot I don't

know what time I don't know we don't

know what time were in bravia we don't

know right first things first we got

figure out where the heck we are yes so

let's all go as a group as Caprice is

walking downstairs I think he really

wants no well that's all go as a group

now I have some rope let's all tie each

other together so no one gets lost in

the mist I know is the thing okay

it sounds like all these weird things

from living in burrow via 450 okay all

right we need to get our chalk and I

have to make sure that I have the the

ghouls times just in case someone gets

hungry just so we know yeah so she's got

like this list in her head and he's like

alright we're gonna tie each other down

there we could actually take waffles

waffles might actually help us because

she is big and scary she is but I don't

want her running off and getting lost if

she gets lost in here we're never

finding her that's true all right let's

go well where we go like I'll I'll leave

looking's or similar that with my

magical my staff can turn into a quill

so I threw the magic markings so strict

wherever I say so make up markings that

we can use to find a way back right all

right we need torches to we need light

those in burrow via don't like light so

let's get torches from the house sure so

we all need torches like I need all

adventury supplies and rations ok so you

find any wooden shards just take those

you might need them okay yeah is this

gonna say like this is so much more

planning than in a sea team please let's

go let's go car whoo glow man I guess

would be an excellent source of light no

he's already domain yes he's

substantiated yeah it's just like you

see the light just shift and he just

immediately goodbye I was just gonna say

would you would you like to help it

stresses watching us like what it's it's

just dancing lights but it worked well

in the form of a humanoid once and then

I just like him

there's like a full-sized man no boy

yeah and I puppeteer him it's not an

entity of its own I wish he was our

friends have a boy that is a puppet yeah

friend obviously

so you have amassed an incredible supply

of anti-vampire technology gorgeous

obviously well represented in your kit

baloney sandwiches one presumes highest

oh yeah yeah good pies at the ready yeah

and she's tying ropes around everyone

okay so upon opening the front door of

you're facing me I almost fell one more

thing oh the door closes you guys deaf

word deaf horn

death horn all right cool big magic

right now you're ready to go now we're

ready to go when that as the door pulls

inward there is just a like a physical

presence

of fog that just you can just see it

hungrily entering the house and breaking

over your hand as you draw the door open

as I suggested before this cobbled just

outside the house this is Waterdeep

Kabul this is your home in water deep if

this is burrow via it has changed quite

a bit the hell oh can I

arkhan and check this yeah absolutely

cuz I think it might be the shadow fell

oh I got a two but I mean that's still

that's no ten yeah this is this doesn't

have the it has it has a physicality

that the shadow fell resents and resists

but it's not Peru via no you don't think

so this this looks like a this looks

like a cold moonlit water deep before we

ended the last game we all the color

drained out is that right for borromeo

no that's not a Borromean thing no

that's a shadow yeah hey Chris you know

magic and weird stuff do you know

anything about this Oh or can it for a

dollar more are you gonna trade your

chamomile yeah I'm going for it today

that I was like 23 tell me what you're

trying to determine I want to know how

this plane or how this water deep

section like is it burrow via

reconfigured is it contained somehow in

burrow via is it like what's sort of a

construct is this well you have you have

been to water deep briefly right a

couple times this mmm looking around

here it doesn't match up with what you

know of burrow via proper when you when

you take in this scene

the thing that like the primary thing

that you take away is it's like someone

tried to draw a map of Waterdeep after

having been there a couple times the

scales are wrong I mean as you as you

move through this place even you know

having been there once that things

aren't quite right like this small park

isn't quite here but it you would

remember it being close to there hmm

it's a Miss remember yes yeah it's

almost like a sketch of the place

anything you get up to close has fine

details but as you are in it it almost

looks like have you ever been to like

Legoland yeah you know how Legoland has

got like a part and it's like hey this

is this is this town but it's made of

Legos but it's like it's only monuments

that's the that's the overwhelming

takeaway this is right this is like a

tourist map this is like water deeps

greatest hits so we walk outside like

the yawning portals there and we're like

that's not here it's just right here in

the middle of this yeah like no that's

definitely indoors somewhere no you're

passing almost just out the front of the

inn you can see or your your new place

you can see wow yeah yeah like that like

a spook yeah it h aus you can see a like

a topiary garden that has made all the

more malevolent by the lighting scheme

I am wondering we were stuck in

nightmares once does this feel like that

- you mean like dead dark yeah what how

many of you possibly wasn't here it's

not Denver but it's it's she also didn't

whisk us away in mist idea stars like

patting his back almost instinctively

real quick just almost searching what

are you doing nothing just I'm pretty

sure it's not

and is that just as a caution to our

audience if you think that you have

denned our talk to you're just from us

from the from waffles incorporated like

if you think that you may be suffering

from dengar don't we thank you real

quick

thank you just saved on Catherine's

relateed endar was a night serpent evil

gone up Schultz Macy works on nightmares

when he put us in nightmares that were

sort of not like the real world sort of

like this person nightmares are

basically our worst premonitions come

true it was true but it also wasn't if

you see a dabbing goblin heads up don't

deal with that make a note maybe no

Rosie how are you absorbing this I've

been to water deep before many times I

think and this is this is for Rosie this

would be like obviously we're in

someone's projection it reminds me of

the the in like that our our first test

market situation and so a planer yeah

yeah so I think that she'd be taking it

in stride but but understanding that

whatever whatever laws would apply in a

place like water deep are not the case

also the shadow fell connection I think

is probably not lost on her either

especially like the draining of color

and so if she had even like the remotest

sense that we would be interacting with

the shadow fell in any way she'd be

extremely on her guard

so she's yeah I think but the key that

you know I'm not talking much because

neither is really like she's just like

oh and the staff of the master yeah she

got it okay it's with you yeah you can

just sort of see it like bobbing up

behind her like physically slicing

through well thick fog I need to get a

we're not precession check from knife

from you too fast

from strings oh well how are you tower

so you tie everybody up so you are you

walking single file like long enough

it's just you know between us so there's

some

lack it's just so no one gets lost in

the mist staggered diamond yeah

secretary formation what is it with all

12 okay

the there is a kind of shudder as you

are continuing to walk through this

garden there's a kind of shudder that

seems to possess the topiary sculptures

Oh sort of a little bit over here and

then over here as soon as you notice it

it stops but it seems to be sort of it's

it's like they're it's like they're

passing around the the right to shutter

very briefly thank you

the bushes are shaking what where those

blood on there shuddering I don't know

she is pointing it perfectly still

bushes

oh are you shuddering and maybe that

just looks no I'm getting that you're

you're barmy look so let's just go ahead

and keep walking just look there like

that another day for strikes I do I do

like an investigation yes but no Rosie

you do have no save it up yeah stand up

for that good stuff alright makes sense

yeah so you just you you take your staff

of the master and basically like it goes

straight through it clean

mmm I got like a like a done cake nice

it can be withdrawn a good baked without

moisture wonderful okay so there's no

there's no friction there's no push back

this is Lily she's like sorry this is

great okay good good definitely goes

through I'm saying that it doesn't

strike an organ guy of some kind okay

everyone stay on high alert and from

there death is like instantly it's like

constant eagle-eyed to like everything

almost letting like the rest of the

party choose the direction and he's just

constantly checking the arc in front of

them absolutely

um rolling the shift please

we didn't see anything there's nothing

here Jerry

Chuck all right 15 15 15 as well do I

I got a what do we order this 12

I'm wrestling it's easy I promise I

promise this better decks that you got

12 12

how are you get six uncharacteristic

yeah you were ready

what is Isis it was two ready I secured

a 19 mechanically speaking this is what

that means when as soon as as soon as

Deus face assumes that air of firm

command and he tells everyone to be on

their lookouts a gigantic fist made of

black bark and sharp leaves falls

directly on top of his head

exactly I am assuming and I think I'm

correct that your AC is not 13 nose much

higher than that okay good

is your AC 19 no okay so the first one

you're able you're able to get just out

of the way and then when the second one

goes over it's like it's like they're

playing slap jack on your skull the next

one comes down directly over oh goodness

gracious maybe this creature is too

powerful

well let's see 14 that damage yes okay

so it's like the first hand coming down

do you like almost oh yeah just I like

one hand in me like almost Tokyo Drift

all the way yeah nice and as the second

ones coming Dolly's hopping out of it

and but still gets kind clipped yeah but

he's still yells uncanny dodge

damaged nice so I'll take the seven he

died just on your channel e yeah yeah

but makes him like actually like fall

like roll like roll a little bit not

crazy like you actually got hit in the

middle of it's not like actually it's

like he's not facing national one of the

topiary sculptures just rolls itself

straight off of its platform and

razor-sharp fists begin to burst out

from its central core cthe wrist route

from the building no no this is like

what's this one made up this one right

here looks as though it might have been

a massive crow at first but now it's a

crow with fish it's a guardian mode

Varitek um so Chris yes AC fifteen

sixteen now okay so I bet you're glad

you put on this ring now now here comes

the second one and it swipes over your

head Strix and does not connect Rosie

bee stinger yeah what are you gonna do

some gardening yeah on branch you know

it it's Mother's Day you have two

targets okay there are now these sort of

twisted lumpy sculptures I will do a

whole bunch of the sauce so to maximum

sauce yeah I'm gonna go for the one who

is on DF and I'll go for that one first

I'll deliver two sauce and then I will

multi sauce I will deliver two sauce to

the other men that'll be a 22 and a 14

fun first one I would like to attempt to

stunning strike on both of those mm-hmm

which means conse of 13 okay oh no fun

that first one okay good so that's a key

point and then it's a key point it's a

key point so that one is now stunned

making it and she bops it over to the

other one just does the same sauce

we'll be a seventeen and a ten I love it

honey I heard those hit no 17 yeah yes

absolutely not no and I've stopped roll

down yes

and then also attempt a stunning strike

on the one that hits cons a 13 please no

okay so that is also stunned and you're

jumping around

yeah the damage did I hit with both on

the first the first guy both of those

both my hits okay so that's gonna be 10

points of damage on the first one and

six points of damage on the second one

and they are both stunned

spread it out until the next turn that's

delicious isn't it it really is

next up we have Chris trout don't like

it I don't like it do I get the sense

that these entities could be dissonant

Lee whispered to well I don't know I

mean if they're if they're trees like

what do I think that these are well it

talks to trees all the time

yeah that's true that's true let's go

for it you haven't seen you you haven't

seen anything quite like this really

yeah but but you don't see any reason to

believe why that I wouldn't try and okay

all right then I'm gonna go for it

I'm gonna choose one of them and I will

whisper coldly shoot oh I'd sit across

from you for the 22 minutes entire

Tuesday part of the time yeah and that's

versus was the DC 15 wisdom is is

surprisingly not these plant

where's you know your strong suit so

let's find out no very healthy yeah you

can you can do all the damage you want

Oh YUM and then it will also have to

flee after this after these messages

all right so that's going 5-5 d6 let's

do it slowly 2 1 plus 6 that's a very

high number wonderful 9 so far whew 5 so

now at 14 17 mm-hmm and run away crying

make like a tree immediately upon

hearing what any topiary loads to hear

it oh it's almost like a the movement

pattern is almost like a slinky it sort

of swallows up and then rolls back

through like tears through another part

of this urban beautification project and

finds its way out down some shadowy

alley next up is it stunned oh well I

wouldn't under both ah let's see

stunned incapacity and can't move wake

it up but then it but wouldn't it wake

up when I attack one nice that's that's

how is how I have fun that no it's

that's now son works son is until the

end of my next turn which is why it's

exciting beating is that the is that the

condition stunned well how come

sometimes I'd use hypnotic pattern does

that stun you tell me it depends on the

creature okay cuz I remember it's like

don't touch him because of the way come

up don't attack them leave it alone okay

Wow son yeah haha okay so it's it is

flattens itself out hypnotic patterns

charmed yeah yeah on the ground okay

next up we have the trash which yeah I

already did it I already counted

a level-five fireball careful spell

right in the middle of this garden and

burn it to the ground just catch as many

as you can many as I can I think that's

going around my friends they just make

it just making little pockets where the

fire does not exist exactly and I did 34

points of damage

good and their plants Jerry don't forget

their fancy they're their plants but you

can the and it looks really cool I feel

like she takes well pan just like turns

it into her staff and the dreams it on

the ground and the air just goes out

yeah and you've you've had many exciting

times burning plants mm-hmm with this

spell but they seem dude like instant

they mostly smoke as opposed to burn

like the like the flames get batted out

pretty quickly like obvious obviously

they're they're damaged by this spell

but there's like a black smoke from some

resin on their leaves or trunk grace its

did snow then it's awful

yeah okay got it okay dear yeah yes

so this one that smacked me L mean yeah

angriest at this one I'm never seeing a

rosy definitely move along the

battlefield is almost like yes finally

someone else yes so to kind of almost

bet that he will find like a nearby

fence or lamppost or other water Davian

structure to leap off of that you will

have no shortage birdbath like yeah you

want just just some small stone

structure to leap off of that pulling

out gutter and like leaping get this

plant that's stunned and just like

reverse grip down just right down yeah

yeah yeah whatever

whatever strange central system it has

trying to find it with yeah but see we

got so it's done yeah Oh third you say I

have an advantage I guess

would you know cheated right here who I

gave it that's done waffle fam we're

delivering some booze here you're

serving death dishing it up do you have

some we have some hot s 4s Alyssa oh

this is jack box party pack 3 level up

size with a Jasper set D and even

legendary bundles nice work dude roll it

big pile of dice oh my god there's no

one what I'm telling you company anytime

you want a you have this experience what

what like this is cool you're about to

find out this plant is about to find out

61 oh all right so so you it's like as a

young person do you recall the depends

on where you grew up

whether you have access to something

like this a pitch blister mmm on a tree

oh I think I know yeah I know you're

talking yeah yeah so some some trees on

their surface we have these raised

blisters of pitch and if you're a young

person then such a tree is around you

occasionally do pop them and that is

more or less what has happened here

right like the sword goes straight

through some nodule for a lack of a

better something that looks pulsing

indeed and when you you you pull out the

sword and something clings and then

snaps yeah yep

oh that's really gross okay so these

these bad guys do not go because they're

taking a nip nap without life what's

that that one's alive still oh yeah oh

yeah he's profoundly so definitely got

glasses in the fall like how he can die

yeah okay he's gonna be the first

shambling mound in his family you know

I'm good really dreams so but in the

mist just outside this slightly lowered

garden area you can hear the sound of a

wooden wheel squeaking against the

cobble and you can see a lantern

swinging at the front and you can see a

sort of passing through the tall bushes

that sort of make this plant wall and as

this thing is is approaching you can see

that Lantern sort of dancing on the edge

and you can hear a footfall light just

outside the arena of conflict rosy be

stinger okay that's cool but we got a

deal with these hey listen these bad

boys yeah

now I'll put him to work I don't know

this outfit on my head is if I attend to

stunning strike them again does that

renew them for the next turn or are they

since they are still stunned until the

end of this turn yeah I mean I don't

think that you can restart while stunned

well stunned yeah I think they already

have that kindig condition okay I guess

well I'll just give him the phone yeah

Joost

alright so here we go that's gonna be at

26

that's gonna be at 23 that's real hit

where are you focusing your your tender

administration probably on the one that

that's a good just get well then the one

that did not get no you said I was a

good cost of the one that yeah so those

are both hits greatest hit does it

that's gonna be a nineteen and that's

gonna be another nineteen okay yeah

these are all hit okay I've been rolling

around damage today so I'm gonna do the

correct one why not why not you know so

that's gonna be you know so many Dyson

none or twenty I'm not even mad I'm just

saying like because I want because

anything that we don't give away I get

to keep so that's true that is true so

that's twelve eleven twenty three and

another six and another eight

yeah so another 37 or so so massive

massive blows like the just the strength

of the swing bending the staff of the

master in midair all of that kinetic

energy delivered let's stop the master

like having any kind of special effects

no no you're you're not you're not

getting a shadow vibe okay from this

zone but it is definitely it's having

the effect of murdering them if like if

it's felt weird it would tell me right

it has to tell you yeah exactly

no no so you so you bring this you bring

the staff of the master down once twice

three times it starts to get up and do

its best to respond and then the last

one hits and then as it tries to get up

it actually just snaps nice yeah at the

top it just sort of snaps in half and

then shutters next up is Khafre strobe

not fun anymore

Eldridge blasts no I'm not going to do

that well because garbage let's see so

that one doesn't look so good

no I'm gonna focus up on that and this

time kill date tonight

did you the first ones toast okay good

all right well in that case I'm not

gonna bother with damage on the other

one I want to offer advantage instead oh

this is I saw this is Gil with this

blade and then I saw this Oblivion

incredible alright listen that wasn't 61

that was a very long time for him to

wait for the high five K I didn't know I

didn't know was there like here she gets

tunnel vision when she has to offer SAS

look I can't hope to compete with that

so I'm gonna just do enable others yeah

fairy fire and make this this tree

line it up for the for the holidays and

that was I could see more pulsing things

yes yeah and it gets everybody gets

advantage again right right yeah yeah on

that gun that goose and that silly goose

fresh which Strix what's next all right

um I would like to do pull the dead now

you would so and I've never done this

before no you haven't watch so on I

guess the the large remaining guns one

so it's the target I'm never gonna fit

it's it's ready it's it's at its full

height okay the target has to pass a

wisdom save or take damage if it's

missing any hit points the damage is one

d12 necrotic damage

otherwise it's one d8 but I'm gonna do

it at fit so I'm sorry it is fit but be

kind of because I'm tenth level or

almost sorry level because I'm fake

level I get to d12 right so hard

it's to d12 and it's a can trip juicy

yeah because I thought I'll just replace

his trash compared to that with my

saddle on the ground and just send out

like a pulse of energy at this thing to

try and exactly die and it's the first

time you've ever cast no so the save the

save attempt does not go through so this

is so dear you have never seen this

never side of this the hand motion that

accompanies it the whispered words and

then the terrifying Bell that you can

feel in your bones when the staff

strikes the ground so it's 13 necrotic

damage so that day staring arrest

awesome so useful so you oh absolutely

you can see it just in portions in

patches you can see leaves and tendrils

just drying out in de cada bleah

crackling as they lose their sucker next

up its dias all we need is another 61

points of damage

yeah so so the first one that I like

stabbed into it you said like it snapped

was it like around the knee like it fell

forward or incitement in basically the

what you can see is mostly leaves like

it has its body is grows in such a way

clearly to protect these places but

you're not sure it's stable because each

of them has a completely different body

shape when it was slain did it like kind

of crumble to the ground

definitely okay yeah so like Diaz is

basically still on it as I'm happened so

as the coming down he just rides it as

it hits the ground down- tumble forward

and just run up sort of sees the fairy

fire to a pulsing thing yes another

two-handed like thrust

yeah hardest you can find it in there so

it's casting light now yeah that's being

sort of carried out in a Nimbus the

dancing lights coming off of gutter the

F is on the young side for Rosie but she

likes damage that'll be a 23 that's

healthy great so it's not a Christmas

time so I won't do it as much oh cool

all right

that was a seven animal nerf rogues

never Dias wat c24 look it's only

because my magical short sword drinks

the blood of the enemies a scary name to

sew down from the side you can like

those footfalls become a patter of

lights old shoes down the stone stairs

into this low area where the garden is

and you can see someone dressed in a

colorful way that manages to somehow

resist and stand out against the gloom

that's what we do so nurse oh absolutely

okay there the gloom that collects

around in this place and she

has she has a silver sickle with her

that she draws out and she scrubs

another hmm

and she jumps onto this creature and

begins to apply her train steals our

kill just like no XP god no levels for

you she great time will recognize IO

sees it she with deaf skill interest and

tactics she alters visibly the shape of

this thing with clever quick cuts and

then she looks over at you

rosy and says it's here too and then it

swings like the back of its fist right

at her over toward the side of the

entrance so the first hit comes back

just like the back just this shredded

bark comes back down puts her on the

ground and then the other hand slams

down on the top and then scoops her like

drags her across the ground okay inside

no oh

inside of its body and deposits her

there and then seeks yeah this can

happen

Rosie be steer ah this sucks okay car

you punch

uh-uh yeah all right so yeah I'm gonna

aim for the extremities I suppose on

this or whatever we don't cool I like

her snickles okay so I guess I'll just

go blow some more key points on this

floor yeah so again

Tejada again and it's so very fired yeah

oh yeah how long does the ER last I

think it's just there it's just the

information up to one minute so okay oh

wait I'm oh I'm happy time that's a lot

here we go 24:12

whole system just a pile of garbage I'm

24 Ann's a 19 so three hits three hits

okay so let's see what you got

it's gonna be beautiful one five points

of damage

eight points of damage and nine points

of damage so 22 points of damage total

very healthy yeah thank you I say

healthy but I mean really really because

it's like it depends on our point of

view and she's thinking now she we saw

the state this this person gets

swallowed but we haven't heard chewing

or digesting yet so she's definitely

striking around though got a good

feeling get outside go through stroke

but Keturah says it's been fed it's

sleeping attack and now I'm excited by

that that tolling of the dead I'm gonna

told the dead yeah pull up on some dead

both they are both just doing the nights

just just over here like me yeah I'd

stand up right next like Journal Agati

back into a staff and then I bring him

down on the ground yeah he he squawks

malevolently love these 15 I was just

gonna say he his his save fails I'm like

mine yeah

you know you only get to do one to

twelve no I have to Oh past level five

well I had eleven I do three yes

all right so here's gonna be two of them

oh my god really

yes eleven plus twice awesome good lord

now how does this like do you guys

compare dick sizes about this is there

anything about his is there anything

about his tall like the sound that hate

that his strike produces in this I think

that where what was what is your sound

what was my well we decided we always

had a bell told the dead house would

just be like like birds like crows would

be my guess yeah it sounds like a yeah

yeah maybe some creature from sigil that

no one else whatever executioner's

Ravens executioner raven like calling

I'm not imagining like a like a like a

crystalline like a like a like a ring of

the wine guy like a weird resonance that

you can tell is like its little too long

no it got and it starts before the staff

hits oh yeah that's just like the apex

of it right yeah it's like it's like

that implosion bomb in Episode two yes

Star Wars it's just all the sound goes

away like it no as this as this first

wave and then second wave something in

this crystalline sound is just inimical

to the life of this creature and it

begins to just wither and crack and as

it as it tries feebly to escape limbs

are just cracking off and shredding

until there is simply a luminous

colorful carfully garbed young woman

whoa

separating herself from the rest of this

evil wicker basket but wouldn't told her

we're done we're done done nice Kilda

good job everybody

so immediately do myself or stretched

recognize who this person is

it's possible that you recognize her

mode of dress which is vez Thani if a

bit more traditional all right

I will walk them and heal her so happy

if keeps good or out at the ready that's

great

so I'll look at walk up and heal her and

just two regular cure wounds and rosy

points to her she looks like a thrist

she's like you can do you could heal you

just heal people

no I can't no I need she's like I see I

don't understand why I can heal people

ago I'm related to Devils I understand

sorry other people's stuff alright so

what do you what do you got here strict

no I'm just doing a 1d8 for healing so

it's two plus my ability modifier shy

like never I don't heal that often so

which is four so so she's six

hey it's not much more than she had come

from yeah and I was just doing it at

first level I didn't even do in a higher

level I just gave her six to be like

yeah hope you're okay absolutely she

exhales sharply as as if even the

closing of the wound had a toll to it

and she says you are strangers here man

I'm debatable wait at what time what is

the word in burrow via or correct

something like it oh what's something

alike

we we travel these mists with ease

am going to recommend that you enter my

cart would come with me away from this

place why the hell should we trust you

yes you have no need to trust me it is

simply an offer that I make you would

the first to mistrust my people no doubt

out of a ridiculous and old-fashioned

racial animus deal with strods but you

don't know this John is right she spits

I mean she's mention of the racial

animus because this immediately like

steps over Baxter and is like I'm not

your energy

all right now Chris your stroke yes I'm

ready let's go do you have I'd like you

to roll your history yes I'd love to do

that it's 9b great that's 9 9 that's

grotesque yeah I tried imagine you

should be ashamed

it's just a very specific history that

he would be looking up although I think

that you might know it as well why don't

you why don't you go hey and give it to

me we're gonna miss Donnie knowledge

let's keep coming mr. ham is 20 shadow

council your gross tricks bringing the

goodies we got another package coming up

when Alyssa comes back I'll tell you

what it continues so you you think that

she is dressed for a wedding I would

know that

yeah like but for people who for people

who it's not the kind that isn't the

type of wedding that you do now a modern

mastani wedding is it has an odd hmm -

it has a nod to the tradition but these

weddings nowadays are designed to happen

and then at a moment they can disperse

purely for safety reasons this is an

index of a person with an attachment

okay

to a deep well of this Doni culture this

was this is a mode of of dress and pride

that that represents someone steeped in

it in the old ways all right so I will

sort of relay that to everyone then also

be like what is where is the wedding she

says we're going to it now whose wedding

is it you'll see no no I need names

we names here names whose wedding is it

is it strawed and Esmerelda by chance if

it's those two we don't want any with it

Horst rod and arena yeah anyone named

that arena or no no there is no wedding

forced rod or arena that's good I know

this story

oh that's good chuckles the current

Rendell's to life waffles hoots

alongside and she says do you know much

of our waste not you not this man of

course being racist of course he's

already made his will known in these

matters

wait what do you know I'm confused what

do you ever get dear what no it's dears

it has something you can star people

that's weakened what we can cover that

in another time what guys I'm not racist

are you tell you ideas or someone

like dia I don't know a lot of people

that look like him gives people like me

looks like that and I don't like in any

case in any case how much do you know of

our weddings well unfortunately we were

exposed to one unwillingly that we

thought was a resurrection sort of

experience but it or well I guess like

sacrificial sole experience but in what

in what way it sounds like that sounds

like no wedding - well there was a raven

costume of your breathing costumes

there's a raven costume and then there

was a arthur the priest lost his eyes

whoa yeah they were just smoking holes

at the end of it but there were two

rings at the end the death and I got

that were part of our friends soul I

know parent Lee we're married and

they're gone

do you okay now we're not married

do you have manners it's something do

you have these Springs no we do with you

not with not we they're gone we know

where they can be found though they're

likely still safe in Red Lodge while

you're using your research days yes that

is good that's good to hear

she says I am his R and then she says

this the cart breaks out of the forest

which is sort of commingled with the

mist to create something that looks like

walls are amazed as the light of the

lantern casts out through the columns of

the trees and as she breaks out into

this clearing you can see that you're

nearing some kind of an edge or cliff

and at that at that edge they dance a

bit gentle lights seem to cling to that

edge and she says well do you know about

the first wedding do you know what the

wedding ritual is based on no no I'm

sure man Brickton does yeah

I do but I just want to hear you say it

she what is awaiting the mention of Van

Rycke ttan her her voice like there is

like a involuntary expulsion of breath

we don't really like him either she says

you know Van Rycke ttyn is an idiot at

best at best a tourist a cultural

tourist he pretends acknowledged but we

Vista me are used to being misperceived

mistreated misunderstood but it never

occurred to us that we that he would

turn out to be our greatest ally in a

way so he imagines himself an expert in

our ways and when he manufactured those

rings it was as though it was as though

we had become wed again in a way do you

know the story of lashka and the deer no

it's very much the story of this place

whatever dive happened to recognize

these names at all

this is a weird one I'm gonna have to

I'm gonna have to ask for some history

checks and you do have the shadow

council / waffle fam is giving you some

goose you want to try it also look for a

little more juice so a lot of that

ultimate history though 15 very healthy

I can try anybody 20 on it before yeah

that's yeah that's my 12 16 16 I can

consume my father's books you've you

have specifically researched there sunny

weddings it's possible that you might

have something clunking around in there

good it gets a bad boy yet he's done

some research

yeah I mean I was hoping to get 20 so

somebody could get a present yeah but in

terms of history that's 21 that's that's

quite good

okay so the rituals the vasana rituals

that you've investigated

so we she begins to relate this tale

you're matching it up point by a point

in your head they're not always called

Luschka and vidya some of the stories

call them different things but it's a

kind of it's a kind of origin myth for

vez thani marriage mm-hmm and

essentially the idea is it's recognized

even now even in modern vez thani

weddings there's always a recognition of

the entities they call Lashkar m'dear

and inside that is that lovers are

always in great peril that's just an

understanding of the wedding ritual that

by joining together you are creating an

avenue for attack and the wedding's

themselves offer this sucker to vedere

and lashka they say let us love let us

bear children and in the future your

feast will be even greater and so

there's always a kind of gallows

recognition of that of that the danger

that is inherent in love and so the that

part that these are up ends at the very

end is that the mists of the deme plane

of dread of Ravenloft itself and she

names it Ravenloft well that's what she

says this place is a cominging imagine

these two forces Losh gun vedere always

intimate always close but never touching

always together but always apart ever

since their origin and then she says

they seek creatures in torment because

they think they might have found the

other and they draw those tormented

creatures into themselves and play with

them for a time and then toss them aside

once they realize that it is not their

love her after all and as the cart

begins to slow as we reach this great

gulf this great cliff and then the mists

all seem to be behind the cart and

you're gazing out upon a massive

potentially infinite star field in this

star field you can see massive orbs like

jewels floating in systems and you can

see pulled across like a cloak and in it

you can hear the sound of horses and

carriages and then these are says and

there he is

my love vedere least he still seeks me

but he'll never find me but look at his

plan he will engulf the entire plane and

what and he'll know that we're together

once he has claimed at all and she says

but wait and so there is a portion of

this massive black cloak that is now

reaching around this central almost a

marble that will not allow this great

caravan of his to claim it and she says

I had to thought for a certain and then

you can see her reach into a pouch and

begin to flip cards out there on the

seat there on the deck of the cart and

she says this was to be our time

but now there isn't now there is a war

this is my domain all of reality was to

be ours that is what our love will do

and she says we will not consume you

today vedere and I we can't lay claim to

the prime material today something else

is occurring there you can resolve it

I'm sure please take care of my universe

so that I may claim it and our feast may

be ever greater won't you

and immediately cold air begins to rise

from the ground and you find yourselves

and a massive owl bear and a small

wooden boy falling from a height of

perhaps 20 perhaps 30 feet around you

you can see a small walled city uh

that's rising up on a kind of bluff or

cliff and you can see a castle keep high

up back to the right and as you come

into contact directly with the ground

each of you in your own place in this

town you can see that just above you in

the heavens above demons and devils have

begun to tear each other apart that is

the end of our game that is episode 4 of
