hi everybody welcome to our D&D game

dice camera action name is letting out

his inner seal we've all been there

let's be real it's true as always it's

true yeah all right

previously in dice camera action the

characters fought their way out of

burrow via only to find themselves

hurled against Giants in the frigid

north then born by airship to the

jungles of cult where they battled all

kinds of beasties to end the death curse

plaguing the world and then they set

sail for home

landing in water deep amidst a maelstrom

of political intrigue and other

nastiness only to settle down in the

Waffle House a mansion owned by Magnus

Burnside's

in the North Ward of the city they've

had many visitors they've had many

travails most recently

palton was reunited with the ring of

winter which he managed to get rid of

recently giving it to Alessandra ray

Burton Miranda Moon Whisperer and the

ice contract ice construct Gwyneth now

it is time for a well-deserved vacation

the waffle crew is finds themselves

greeted by a particularly warm early

summer day the Sun is blazing down upon

the roof of the Waffle House people are

out in the street Fanning themselves

looking for water staying in the shade

to stay warm and the idea of running off

to the beach this is a potentially

welcome one I'll assume this was evil

loons idea any opportunity to bask in

the warmth of Lysander I think it was

probably like someone was complaining a

never getting a break or like someone

was in the dark and even got the idea

that someone needed sunshine like real

sunshine and now she's bouncing around

the house collecting beach toys in

whatever bathing costume evylyn has and

she's like already ready to go to the

beach she didn't even ask anyone if they

wanted to go to the beach

she just started like packing the van

for the beach trip 50 so what is what is

evil ins Beach costume I mean Holly what

did what what what is a fantasy /

medieval bathing costume I mean I don't

know people just got in the water and

they're clothed so that's how I would

say I mean she could just wear the dress

that she wears but she wouldn't probably

do that it would just I just say go with

like fantasy monitor and do what you

want this is fantasy have fun yeah yeah

I I don't recommend chainmail bikini as

they get off so like evylyn has is just

like getting ready has it officially

been announced to everybody else or like

beach trip awesome we're leaving in five

minutes straight

[Laughter]

there is no chest there is that chest of

yours DF by the way sitting in a corner

five minutes huh if you have anything

important to do that you'd like to do

before we leave might be a good time for

a solo time I don't know what are the

kids doing when they find out about

Beach trip okay not as like what is the

beach we can't just not take them right

no the kids are all coming squiggly net

not help help help squiggly and jinx get

dressed

I feel like jinx is already ready jinx

is like like probably lived for this

beach day he's I feel like he's got like

a striped old-timey one-piece bathing

suit on like like when winds and a big

hat with a flower on it I like to

imagine when squigglies name is called

his head pokes up out of a pile of

garbage he was in in strict like mom

where are we going oh what's the beach

are you doing in here sleeping oh God

so I'm not going to the beach get out of

my room so one good simons and she's

like now remember Simon none of the kids

are allowed to swim without you as their

buddy you have to teach them how to swim

or let us know if they're drowning okay

you're the best swimmer really you know

how to swim without breathing underwater

um yes maybe I don't know what did you

ever swim when you had to breathe before

hmm

no oh well maybe you should practice

that a little bit too okay water in case

you were wondering yeah I knew that okay

just checking

so when last we saw the kids they had

gotten some gifts Jencks you have a

golden wand that can turn that's right

other things and

squidly has a pet monkey who can steal

gold and NAT has a small little talisman

very similar to Dias a little crystal

pendant that lets her hear question how

long ago about was were these gifts

given oh about a week does said monkey

probably need to be fed if monkey needs

to be fed monkey hasn't given any

indication Lucy seems to be able to fend

for herself okay I was just gonna say

squiddly has definitely not fed that

mother okay she's not looking any more

emaciated than she was when squidly got

her cool well that's way to teach him

responsibility also his waffles coming

to the beach I feel like waffles could

carry our beach umbrellas I think that

even has been packing waffles like the

van yeah there's like an umbrella

sticking out of another and she put like

little blue zinc oxide on her beak oh my

god and what was this like outside like

hooting like like the honk of the car

still isn't out of a room she can't like

gridlayout

I like to think waffles is like excited

to so she's like with her feet like to

be tapping yeah yeah

Alton's like walking out of the door and

he's like dragging a giant like heavy

santa present Zak all right I packed the

essentials really heavy nope they're the

essentials well I already packed the

essentials so much or could you act hate

this vacation I have specific needs that

are very unique to everyone and

therefore I packed my own bag okay I

keep dragging up it's just like

just like clanking soap Alton you can

see there's no room for your giant bag

on waffles because evylyn has optimized

and maximized all the available first

base but your mule Lance in a small cart

are parked under the awning should you

wish to use that way he's not dead

I thought that wins I've been feeding

him you just hear from upstairs your

strikes takes care of all the animals

and feeds all of them yeah no one even

knows it's like how no one knows that

the chicken foot cabin has been has been

there the whole time right cool that

works and you can leave the coven by the

way to sort of maintain the store if you

want yeah I will and I'll give them

specific instructions I haven't left my

room yet what am I talking about Strix

has given them those histories but she

hasn't left yet she's still like

deciding what she wants to take off like

she's like putting her cloak off and

then putting your cloak back on and then

like putting it back off and then

looking at like because she got the

staff of power last time yes he's afraid

of that she'd like decided that it it

was scary

like she doesn't feel comfortable with

it so it's just in a corner with the

robe on the bottom and she's just been

looking at it cuz it's scary and it was

from a scary man he's uh did last we

left did warrington go anywhere he's

here yeah unless you saw him he was

upstairs in his attic room oh please let

him where that's not tell Warren no no

packing this buddy Freddie bring it on

down use your big hippo strength can't

get in the cart maybe he doesn't even

want to be in the water you know just

because he's a gift doesn't

automatically mean he likes water you

know I'm not gonna stereotype yeah he

when when people call out to warrington

he doesn't respond but last you saw him

he was up in his room oh god I don't

sure thing I will head up - okay his

door is closed so I go up to it and I

knock

I don't even knock I just like lightly

tap just like no response all right well

I tried

Evelyn's doing that thing where like the

overzealous parent is like taking

packing and preparing way too seriously

like she's making sure everything fits

for optimizing all the space and she's

brought like multiple different kinds of

snacks from the kitchen and like a tent

you know like things that you definitely

don't need but just in case she's like

really taking this seriously yeah there

are some folding chairs that you found

in the tavern you could have those too

and you can even like make sure that

little names are put on them so

everybody knows which chair is theirs oh

yeah and everyone has like a sandwich

bag with a little PB&J pie in it that

says their name oh my god there's like

some apple slices yes I'm going to

imagine that we be planning for this or

like role relieving at 9:00 a.m. and

right now it's 10:30 a.m. and we're

still trying to get to the vehicle

next to me look I'm gonna try to forget

how the hell he would attach pants I

don't know I don't even know if they

you're welcome

okay so everybody including the kids are

running around outside

Albert Albert is all loaded ready go

Lance and the Kart is packed full to the

brim I've all make Alton stuff yes yes

Albie is floating nearby on his little

harness leash and no sign of warrington

he's still in there somewhere as far as

you know do you want me to go look in

the window I'll just I'll go look in the

window I'll get on my broom and go

office I told him I told him we're

leaving

so I'm also side note can someone also

drive Lance to the beach I have already

had a few and shouldn't yes I'll Drive

late yes thank you I don't know if we

all have room on waffles and I've been

waiting for just the right move around

now she's been on vacation for a long

time but I've been wanting very much to

introduce you to someone especially

Simon Simon do you know how to ride a

horse no are you sure you've been alive

for like 80 years I've been like a

puppet most of that time Simon I

definitely took you on a horse at least

once

okay well I'll show you really quick

because you are you're in charge of

making sure none of the KITT never mind

now do you know how to ride a horse now

it's like I think so okay good enough

now you're in charge of making sure none

of the kids get hurt are you ready I'm

going to introduce you to someone anyone

does the like Morning Glory

I choose you all right

dad constricts like shielding your eyes

yes the Sun shakes some like magical

dust out of remain you Caliban we're

magical in a different plane and she's

like looking refreshed and even goes and

whispers something to her it's clear

haven't seen each other in a while but

that like you know they were they've

been fixing their relationship they're

on good terms and evylyn introduces not

to morning glory and that is like that

climbs up and looks very important on

Morning Glory emotions that the other

kids can climb on behind her squidly

tries to just hold on to the tail and

swing on it

morning glory like keeps just batting it

like you know like a fly is great also

even has just old morning glory where to

go because morning glory is completely

capable of steering herself she doesn't

need to be actually ridden by you know

or guided so not can think that she's

doing a really good job but actually

morning car is just taking care of the

kids

great I think dance we'll see you net up

on Morning Glory and just kind of give

her an odds buck very natural at this

this is my mount for battle you got this

thank you

and also even is just assigned

babysitting duty to Morning Glory

because she realized that all of the

kids were not going to be taken care of

at all Strix will will fly up and check

in the turret window to see if if okay

so he's not he's not in the turret he's

in what's called the attic what used to

be the attic storage room on the for on

the in the Garrett's and so there are

several windows that you can peek

through you can see three of them are

curtain doff but the fourth one's kind

of big and doesn't actually have

curtains and when you appear through

that you can see that he is in there and

he is well make a perception check oh my

god I was just checking to make sure

that he was asleep so he wouldn't have

to deal with him he's not us it's not a

state okay you can see that he is

drawing with charcoal on the wooden

floor well that's weird and you can see

the floor is absolutely covered with

Scrolls as are the the long as are some

of the walls and fern

you can also see that he has what looks

like a several projects in the work in

the works little little gizmos and

contraptions here there and everywhere

Rex is gonna knock on the window he

finally takes notice of you and just

sort of waves at you with a big hippo

hand and that goes back to work and I

just like I like motion like the drawing

like the mama like and I start saying

like it's least he sort of stands up and

dusts off his kneecaps and then looks

down at the floor and says oh sorry

through the window and you can see that

what he is drawn on the floor looks to

you like a map can I do I does it look

familiar to me or close no and it looks

kind of weird it's not like a map of say

a city or a map of a building it looks

like a map of a series of interconnected

chambers with tunnels linking them all

together in a strange Gygax Ian's not

that you'd know that word configuration

okay so it looks like like a Steve Ditko

drawing for my doctor Street yeah cool

okay so I'm just looking at that going

okay wearing that sexy barmy it strikes

you as a rather out of character for the

the proper gift Commodore

right uh well Strix is like we'll talk

about this later do you want to go to

the beach the beach si yes the beach yes

I'll put on my finest whites Oh show

meet you downstairs okay we're leaving

in five minutes

please don't summon anything oh any

friends who goes to look at him to get

his best uniform

okay I don't know what you do at the

beach in your best uniform but that's

fine five minutes later five minutes

later he comes downstairs and he's

wearing his pristine he a pristine white

uniform with the medals gleaming on his

chest I I don't strike soul just layin

next everyone saying so Warrington is

making maps of something and and it

looks like he's gone barmy in the tower

so let's just be extra nice to him even

though he's now appeared in his full

regalia he's already here we're leaving

right now

strict sir starts walking down the

street sorry I think you're not really

sure how long five minutes is all right

now you know those of you who have lived

in Waterdeep almost your entire lives

that the city itself slopes down toward

the doc ward and there's the wharf but

there's no beach in the city proper

there's also no beach out toward the sea

because it's all cliffs or mud flats

there is a small beach east of the city

but it's a little rocky and pebbly and

not very comfortable the best place to

hang out in a beach in water deep is

this island that hedges in a large part

of the harbour south of the city it's

called the deep water Isle

there is a wall the the extension of the

city wall that closes off the Harper

dominates it but there are beautiful

beaches on the inside Crescent of the

island now to get to the island one has

to secure a small boat at the docks and

take it across to the docks or to the

beach on the island so when you get to

the dock ward the first thing you're

gonna have to look for is a ship big

enough to carry you all the island is

nice but that's where everyone goes do

we want to deal with that kind of crowd

I'm getting some relaxation and the kids

just from fine from a rocky beach the

kids don't want to fish they want to

swim and play in the Sun and build sand

al bears I bet that

fish now it's like yes she all right

as a sidenote nat has not been wearing

that crystal constantly she's

experimenting with it in certain

situations but she's expressed that she

doesn't feel like she needs it all the

time she feels perfectly comfortable

talking to everyone she needs to talk to

but she's just been like experimenting

with it now and then and you can tell

it's kind of a very difficult transition

for someone who has never been hearing

before it's a little bit scary and she

doesn't really have anyone that she

trusts to talk to you about it and she

doesn't want to seem weak so she you've

noticed a special idea that she has only

played with it a couple of times yeah

DFSA all right hold on everyone I'll oh

I'll get it

and then EF will go off and acquire

whatever passages they need since he

usually has the money on them and

probably has the most general knowledge

of Waterdeep logistics mm-hmm yeah so

you can always you can leave the Lance's

cart here you might want to leave Lance

here too yeah probably but you can load

everything into two rented row boats and

you can rent them for the whole day for

like a total of a silver piece oh that's

yeah it's nothing yeah you probably just

imagined the coven is made enough profit

decently to cover that oh yeah does

Morning Glory is MIT Morning Glory a

Pegasus does it have a wings or can't

fly I don't remember no no Morning Glory

had wings in the like godly realm okay

but even doesn't remember that she just

thinks right that was like a fantasy she

had okay never mind

so once Morning Glory bears the children

safely to the docks I assume you're

going to dispel her for the time being

no she wants to come the beach she's

gonna get in a rowboat she will need us

over she doesn't breathe okay

so you're leaving her behind knowing

that you can summon her again on the

other side

swim she could also swim yes she's gonna

swim okay not with the children on her

back but no no children are gonna be on

the robot but she's gonna swim along she

wants she's she okay

whinnies with excitement because she

loves swimming great so the horses is

spending time turning things into other

things with his wand the wink going yeah

now he knows that the wand has nine

charges and then they reach and then he

recharges them at midnight right right

is he using up all the charges uh yeah

he just used them up all he's still

learning so he just used them up all in

one he's like Oh roll a d20 okay he's

really disappointed like when you get

like a snack or a new toy you just don't

know when to stop yeah exactly it's I

got a ten okay yeah so he does he want

to turn anything specific in anything

else specific like something useful that

he can use now the you know the

transformations only last for one minute

right yeah um I think he's just just

doing it to like a noise squidly just

like turning things into into fake guns

or something not annoy him but like

encourage him cuz he likes watching him

annoy the other the other the crew so

he's just made like ten guns but I've

got like fake it's like squirt guns yep

yeah so in squeeze gun and then they

turn back into like rat droppings yeah

okay so evylyn as Morning Glory bounds

off the dock into the water and begin

swimming away across to the island it is

around this time that you take notice of

a familiar sight and that is the galleon

eye catcher in the middle of the harbor

anchored you were there recently not

much has changed about the ship other

than you can see what appears to be a

small little jetty going from the ship

to the shore with some of the crew

members on it they're too far away for

you to see who they are but the ship is

very colorful and you remember it well

so busy with other you know

things that I didn't mention something

about that boat I spent some time the

other day on that boat over there and oh

I catch her yeah and see it nice as one

does and I noticed that it had another

part to the vessel underneath like an

underwater boat with a viewing panel and

I saw drow in there it looked like a

like a secret hidden boat under the boat

a boat under the boat mm-hmm I forgot

about it till now cuz I thought maybe

that was just some kind of boat thing

that I didn't know about

I'm more of a land girl horses and

things did it look like every kind of

crab claws or anything at the front of

it more like Alaskans are that right

yeah

it looked like it looked like it was was

made of metal but shaped like a manta

ray yeah I'm not really sure what to

make of that either but that's it's good

to know thanks you Olin yeah good way to

keep an eye out for the citiots that's

good so it would be easier to load

waffles on sand them folks if you sort

of took all the stuff off her and put it

put that put the stuff all in one

rowboat and then got her on the second

one yeah this is one of those math

problems or logic problems yes where

it's like you have three things only one

boat to get back and forth and two

things at the same time the boat sinks

mm-hmm yep we flawlessly figured that

problem she sort of when she's loaded

down she sort of reaches for the bow

there's a trepidation at that she

doesn't want to she's afraid she might

fall in I can I can polymorph her if

that makes it easier on her sure that

will cross might that would cause all

the stuff on her to just fall off of

course oh no I can I can turn her into a

cloud I think the stuff comes with her

oh I see what you're saying yeah yeah

okay so if I turn into a cloud she can

go into the jar yup and I have four

hurry into the jar she goes with all

your stuff yeah and so I'll just hold

her on our way over okay

so you're taking one boat or two you can

technically crowd into one but two might

be easier we'll take two

okay their own boat okay and Strix is

probably rowing that boat with the kids

just like looking she wants to die kids

boat kids boat kids moms driving huh No

yay who's throwing the other boats yes

probably okay so death and Strix who's

gonna get to the island first definitely

Strix okay

so much for that get there dear this

oddly very winded SD it's rowing the

boat like Poland's just kind of with one

knee up at the front of it just like my

common direction we're going in ice this

leg is Captain volscian now you're

wondering warrant oh yes warrant and rut

will sit at the back of the boat like so

you're kind of you're kind of hoisted up

a bit they live keep on rowing you're

doing a fantastic job you a good first

mate here in when Strix docks you just

like it off get off the boat get off get

off kids get off yes they pile off and

immediately run onto the beach all right

all open waffles and put her on the

beach all right you can see that there

are scattered groups of people who have

already claimed certain parts of the

beach but there's plenty of space for a

retinue such as yourself and

obviously when you arrive you do attract

some attention from some of the other

folks on the beach they tilt up their

hats and stare hello wave fabulous day

for a beach visit isn't it what a nice

day some of them way back

do you at the self-consciousness as I

try to not make eye contact with me

what's down while evil is just like

waving at everyone even like flopping

out like blankets that she brought for

everyone to sit on and like arranging

them and put it sticking the umbrella in

the ground so it shades a couple of like

a little beads I'm I'm uh I'm famous

here as well right in the right vicinity

you don't see any of your adoring fans

that you recognize from various taverns

you've been at but what are deeps a big

city you're no doubt your reputation

precedes you you just kind of comes in

you just like anyone I'm wearing just a

swimsuit anyone like paparazzi that's

not there mm-hmm

if you fix this immediately

okay first night I feel like Strix is

immediately looking around like she has

her fishing pole but she's just like

walking along she probably did see hates

her shoes off and just puts her feet in

the water and she's just trying to find

things and the like look for shells and

weird little bobbles and things on the

beach so that's just what she's spending

her time doing just walking up and down

the beach trying to find weird things

and collect them okay as you you you do

find some some little shells and things

on the beach but nothing nothing grand

nothing that really sort of sparks your

imaginations you just got and some of

them are broken of course and you kind

of tuck those away somewhere but keep

them as a memory yes as you're looking

you are somewhat surprised that popping

up out of the water very close to you is

a small little blue ski

and child not human because this child

has fins on its head and on its fingers

and it holds out a beautiful pearlescent

shell for you oh that's really pretty

uh I don't go near it um I'll reach I

probably have one of my pies like I've

packed some snacks with me uh-huh

I assume I still have them from the

battle see when I'll just be like you

want a snack I'll throw it up high that

sort of lands in the water it's a good

snack I don't want your Chinese I don't

I don't trust random objects from

strangers in the water even if you are a

child well it will toss you back the

shell and it just lands in the sand I

know that disappears under the water all

right I look at it I'm like well I guess

uh sort of a pink and silver color oh oh

I just like look around like to see if

no one sees me and then I'm just like

and pick it up okay it's beautiful

happen no you know can I listen to it

yeah you hear the sea also you're into

sea

I'm still like really scared and I I'm

like hold it yeah just like smell it it

smells like it's been in the ocean oh

there's my pie gone oh yeah oh well

that's good he'll walk back to the group

and me like a stranger child with fins

on their head gave me a show well that's

probably fine and just a nice gift to go

with our beautiful vacation day Paul

Tina shadow falls over you and a young a

young man and a young woman come over to

you and say excuse me I'm sorry to

bother you but are you Paul and SEPA

I just in time to help unpack the boat

defiled can I can I try and unload the

big bag by putting it on to strive on

cherubic okay walk off the boat sure

cool

I'm just orchestrating all right bring

back bring back slowly alright

beep-beep-beep them yeah yeah okay it it

brings it to you you can see chair

strapped on chair legs kind of

sink into the sand a bit making a little

bit hard for it to move but it manages

it's okay I'll just like kind of roll

the bag off next to it yeah just like

hop in like like a like a legs over over

the side thing and then just reach into

the bag and anyone who is around

seize that the bag is just like 50

bottles of wine

I knew that paltin just starts chugging

alright that's that's basically the sum

total of what was left in that ships

cargo hold is now on the beach beach day

when you hand Turks back her feather pen

she's gonna turn it back into a fishing

pole and find deaath and be like here

you can fish if you want uh so did

basically took one of the blankets that

you had laid out sat down on it you can

see his backpack is nearby I kind of

flipped open

he's hideous with numerous parchments

around him as he's been like riding on

stuff and it looks like it's like deep

in thought and as you like walk by and

see the parchments you can see it's like

basically him strategizing and coming up

with elaborate plans like some papers or

notes on the castle anteriors like this

oh my god tricks is gonna use

prestidigitation to pile them all up and

put them back into the backpack suddenly

while he's working on like I had those

organized

she's like hauls out the fishing pole

services you're going fishing I will

fish when I'm done I was working on that

and I can't let it be interrupted I look

if you work on vacation day you're gonna

mess with my vibe and I can't allow that

as captain of this ship give you I give

you the order first mate take the day

off you've earned it look I'm outside on

the beach this is nice this is a nice

change of pace it's very very relaxing

and it helps me focus I'm trying to get

all this figured out it's like actually

Lysander and it's like ten feet tall the

kids are busy some of the kids are busy

building in the sand as well you see

Warrington Mont is just standing in the

sand staring back to the city he pulls

out a spyglass

Telescope's it it's just looking back at

the city the Ethel like after seein like

everyone else do everything will like

turn back to Strix with like a like a

kind of like a defeated face and just be

like and then he takes off his boots and

then steps into the sand and like picks

up like a stick or something and starts

like playing in the sand

[Laughter]

he's like base is kinda like fine I'm

relaxing and I'm having fun see it's

like I guess this is the best we're

gonna get

I'm gonna go fish alone then if you're

not gonna go kill fish and have some fun

I'll join you in a little bit just I'm

gonna do this for a little while alright

you have a good time Strix is gonna walk

over and just like start trying to fish

alright yeah she can walk a little bit

down to a section of beach where there

isn't anybody any swimmers or anything

and cast her line um you know she's

gonna do that she was gonna see if like

she's like I'll be can you like flatten

yourself out a little bit as like I like

to walk the Sun he'll just he doesn't he

can't he looks at you stupidly and

doesn't know what you're asking him to

do but he does kind of interpose himself

between you and the Sun so now there's

this little orb lot of shade on your

face that's what I was hoping it's not

white skin get burned so like take a

piece of fabric off a robe and just hand

it up to him and he can just wrap it

around his head like a little baboo

little boy a little ice ox so poking out

from underneath sure he's fine

yeah waffles is running around in the

sand rolling in the sand bounding in the

water making big splashes like a dog

brought to the beach exactly yeah that's

adorable

yeah and then goes running off not well

momentarily terrorizing some other

because yeah I until until they realized

that she's pretty

you know inoffensive and she's just

splashing around them

running off yeah if I catch anything I'm

just gonna toss it to her okay

just make a oh let's call it oh I

don't know roll a d20 okay this is all

chance there's no skill here I got it

too okay you don't catch anything like

in the first hour all right but you do

kind of like the the tranquility of it

you're you're being a tiefling you don't

react to the heat that a lot of people

that the way normal people do because

you're a fire resistant of course so for

you the Sun is not oppressive you don't

feel like you're getting super warm

standing out here but it's actually

quite pleasant that's nice I like every

10 minutes I look back at DF expectantly

for him to start having fun yeah make a

dexterity saving throw Paulie

one while you're looking back at dia

something tugs really hard on your line

and you forget to let go so you just get

right into the water you just hear

screaming well even before that happens

you just go right like sploosh and then

you're screaming underwater God do we

see like the bubble trail like how much

of its do we see you heard a sound in

her direction then you look and you just

kind of see nothing so you're still

hanging on to your fishing pole I assume

Paulie because you don't want to lose

your staff yes and you are being pulled

really really fast through the water

okay nice to turn I'm gonna turn it into

my broom okay

underwater it turns into your broom okay

and I'm like think please go to get

above water

suddenly she Rockets out of the water

straight up on her broom I'm right now

I'm also wet and look very displeased

when you read the air Strix when you're

in the air Strix make a perception check

to see if you can see what pulled your

line is what Strix like when a bird gets

wet and it's just like kind of sad and

yeah yeah I go wet silkie chicken yeah

like you know really attractive in its

own way noticeably distracted it's

mostly sad that was a seventeen you can

see that what pulled you under was big

and it's scales gleam in the sunlight

with a bronze hue it looks like a dragon

what well I know that bronze dragons

aren't mean that's true so um I'm just

like I hold up a hand I'm like did

evylyn could can you help me there's a

dragon I'm yelling this there's a dragon

oh we're playing dragon oh there's a

dragon if we flapping my arms like

trying to shove any context for a dragon

being underwater no didn't like blow one

up once a dragon turtle that's true mmm

so if she doesn't immediately reacts

like oh I'm just like oh okay

by this time Strix the dragon has gone

deep enough that you can't see it

anymore

I swear there was a dragon I just saw a

dragon in the water are you positive

I am a hundred and maybe ninety percent

positive

well what should we do about it was it

just I mean maybe it's a good dragon

it's just chilling I don't know you

didn't you see like a submarine or

something maybe this dragon to the

submarine are in cahoots wishes

Warrington he knows about these weird

things okay water dragons water dragons

I'm sure there are if there are space

dragons they're almost certainly water

dragons but you've never seen one or

heard of one no but I assume dragons

could

swim in the water as easily as they fly

I hate to call off swimming but I

suppose if there's dragons in the water

we serve well there was a nice dragon

even she's still on her broom she's like

it's a nice dragon she lands just like

sopping wet just looking like a sad wet

cat and she's hunching over she's like

it's a nice dragon it's a it was a

bronze dress shiny one the shiny ones

are nice oh yes bronze dragons very nice

well it's gone now I lost it I don't

know why I've bit my fishing pole which

was very rude no I'm just real confused

as to what what help and reaction you

actually want Paulding like kind of

stumbles over and just do you say water

dragons you know there was a prawn

there's a bronze dragon in there

water dragon well you know what here if

you're asking a dragon's like a big

lizard but it's got wings and they're

there remember that one time that big

red one like knocked a building on us

that's what dragons are I maybe I can go

down there I can polymorph myself into

something I can breathe underwater and I

can go down there and make contact with

the dragon I don't want to ruin all the

beach day for everyone because deaath is

having so much fun like and he's guys

like pants like Obama's pants like

actually like rolled up so like just

below his knees and as he look over they

realize he's been like scribbling onto

the sand would look like elaborate plans

and maps dear I told you not to do that

presentation they're all gone do you

want me to do that I can go try the

dragon won't be mean it's a tiny dragon

they're nice I mean if you want to it's

your vacation I guess just be safe all

right okay um I'll be back then is

anyone else want to come anyone else

want to be see animals Nate Nate's

internet it was having trouble so he

might be a boy

now I'm certain there is no no kids no

kids are getting put kids or that's

danger for the kids i spaced out for a

few seconds sigh didn't really hear what

we're talking about but what i gather is

the kids should definitely go in the

wall they're not nope that's not it

school right now who wants no none of

the children one of us needs to stay

here to watch everything in the kids I

asked you like already like Naruto

running toward the water just like more

than me

no squiggly nope I'm just gonna let him

go there he goes there he goes loose he

kind of trips before he gets that we've

balton you're too drunk so you just stay

here D F is not having fun so do you

want to come with me and try and find

this dragon me no you're drunk and we'll

get Diaz hey yes

otherwise yours gonna stay here and keep

scribbling nonsense at the sand so DF

you do recall I'm not sure you remember

this Jared or not having a brush with my

tub what might have been the dragon when

you were underwater scavenging oh I do

remember that but I have not put two and

two together okay does not put two and

two together there yeah it's like yeah I

mean I can help I mean I don't want you

to go somewhere dangerous okay it's just

it's just the ocean and a dragon I what

could go wrong it's mmm yeah yeah I'll

go and squidly swim roll a d20 okay he

went in the water and he hasn't come up

looks up from playing in the sand with

the kids enough and trots over and

ruffles around to try to find squiggly

in the water and tries to like grab them

by the scar

of the clothes and pull them out virus

right with our mouth I like the swim

trunks so like I'm okay the horse will

go in the water look around dunk its

head and come out with a mouthful of

squigglies shorts are squiggly attached

as well that's correct okay good

you know just carry him out like isn't

there a scene in 101 dalmatians like

this where you're carrying em hmm yes

you probably and squiggly it's like

breathing is hard down there the kid

throws up a little bit of water and then

just runs back in the well squigglies

back in the water

you can make it need to make another d20

roll squiggly alright alright got it

this time

oh so what if it was worse okay a

current grabs Quigley and takes him out

into the harbor this is the whole scene

is playing out in strictest just

watching you like let's go play I would

rather deal with the dragon - are you

sure you want to go Dee if you just look

sad yeah I'll go and get will actually

then start removing all of his usual

attire to reveal he was actually wearing

his swimsuit underneath oh you'd

actually did get ready it's like but

like the swimsuit is like just kind of

sad looking it was like a like a burlap

sack more or less that uh it's

definitely been worn before like this is

probably something he's had for years

and I said I kind of changes into this

and like just robes you can see them

just look like a little little little

bashful or even like embarrass by it a

little bit very pale yeah just really

pale it's not attractive let's go she's

like I like your bathing suit that's one



I'll go after squiggly is Morning Glory

watch the other kids between breath

squiggly just like control misterx can

press the digit 8 d s bathing-suit to

make it like at least not like fraying

on the edges that's nice so now looks a

little bit cleaner and just like there

you go yeah like internally there's just

like a thing with death where everyone

else is everyone else like looks so nice

and he's really just using think they

same old raggedy thing that he's had for

years Strix is robas over 80 years old I

think she doesn't look that nice right

now

she's what are you wearing that the

underneath part she's just wearing like

the underneath part so it's like a

tattered shirt dress but she's just

wearing it with nothing none of her

accoutrements on top of it so it just

looks like she's wearing a sack so

they're both wearing sacks oh you guys

both look like Dobby yes um but she'll

she'll just say and is there anything

you want to be particular in the water

anything any kind of animal in

particular you would like to be animal

what yeah we're gonna poly more if you

didn't even need to take your clothes

off just just means fine I like being me

alrighty squidly often this like still

out here strikes is going to polymorph

herself then into a into a penguin okay

with a witch hat all alright so you're a

penguin DF is DL yes and she can she

communicated to DF to pick her up and

bring her with him into the water okay

alright so you wait out into the water

and set the penguin on the yeah on the

wave and you start to swim out yeah okay

after about 40 more than 40 feet

actually closer to about 80 feet the

sand the level of the the water really

kind of drops off and you can

hit this harbor reef as you're swimming

below the water and looking it's quite a

verdant down here untouched unpolluted

[Music]

almost too beautiful yeah circuses

penguin hang around

I think after water death is a

surprisingly adept swimmer mm-hmm yeah

he would be I think I spent a lot of

time doing this especially I'd like to

his treasure hunting days and things

like a lot of stuff underwater yeah and

he knows that deepwater Harbor gets its

name of course from the fact that it

gets real deep real fast like just

abysmal a deep yeah like so when he's

underwater he's like shockingly graceful

yeah and the water gets very cold as one

gets farther out and of course murkier

as well but you swim out looking around

now the harbor is vast

so even a even a dragon can lose itself

in this mist in this dark abyss quite

easily I'm gonna unpack myself and just

like tread water next to Dee of holding

wizened staff and just be like I think

we should get its attention

fireball what you're detonating this

underwater yes okay

all right yes it goes off underwater and

there's this green flash why are we

pissing off the dragon no we want to

meet the dragon well maybe he doesn't

want to meet us a couple dead fish float

by look what you did that was easier so

you didn't want to go fishing now

there's fish you took away the sport of

it all evil and make a perception check

nine okay you don't find squiggly what

ah dang it even with all the yelling

there's no more yelling guys oh this is

not a drill this is why we have the body

system no more swimming till we find

squiggly out near our restriction ds2

squiggly eye well they can't see him so

they don't know well I mean like from

the last point he went swimming

oh yeah there's about a hundred feet

away ones gonna cast I'm gonna double

check that I have it but I'm pretty sure

I do a locate object on something that

squiggly carries on his eyepatch she's

got a locate objects Quigley's eyepatch

okay and located object is a action

right yeah Kaster okay yeah he's he's

below you well do I remember correctly

that even actually can't swim and she

has her boots she can swim she went

under the ship and she has it she has a

decent athletic score so she can do okay

she's just gonna dive for where she

senses squidly is okay into the water

she goes make another perception check

to just follow the spell trail see if

you can find him last ten minutes twenty

great yeah you can see that squidly is

deep under the water he is with a pair

of merfolk do I know anything about

merfolk as a resident of Waterdeep you

would know that merfolk periodically

come into the harbor to conduct trade

with water davian's bringing things that

from the deeper sea and often stay here

for a good deal of time before they go

off back to their their homes and their

clans

so you've actually probably

wanted to see one your whole life and

this is really your first chance to see

one and not just one but two up close

and you can see that you're not sure

what they've done but squiddly does not

no longer seem burdened by the water in

terms of he seems to be coping just fine

able to breathe and stuff yeah

evylyn comes and like joins the

conversation and squidly you saw you

were helped by one of these merfolk and

they cast a spell on me who'd let you

breathe water even I guess also can only

hold her breath for a certain amount of

time so she kind of like joins the

conversation you know by putting her

hand on squigglies back like I'm with

him and she's like yeah the merfolk are

a little perplexed because you don't

look anything like what they imagined

his mum would be and but they were just

kind of showing off some interesting sea

life down here sort of but they they

kind of let him go at that point and

they dart off into the deep water it was

like under water but then she like looks

at squids range and she grabs his little

scruff and swims to the surface with him

okay all right you pull him to the

surface no problem false alarm no

drowning today squigly has lost his

swimming privileges also jinxed I'd like

to imagine his on the beach with like

sunscreen on his nose and his big big

whittling wicker hat and he's just got

like like a big giant book that he's

reading and just like but like under the

shade of an umbrella he looks very

luxurious

he's like sipping out of a drink that

he's made out of like a coconut with an

umbrella wow this is fair okay he's

having a great time as even brings

squidly onto the beach he just kind of

like lays down on the sand starts like

obnoxiously flopping you'll grab me out

of my home that's

my home now I can't breathe on air he

says no longer allowed in the water he

tries to like flop back into the water

and glory just drags him by his little

pants again across the sand all right

the flopping has tired him out he just

falls asleep

as a sand well smile squiggly is sort of

lying on the sand

there are seagulls that are sort of

gathered overhead probably because they

smell lots of food and they're just sort

of hanging out with an ear Jenks and and

the rest of you they're gonna eat me I'm

a fish now yeah they might there's

actually one perched on waffles head Oh

waffles just kind of sitting there tired

out on the wet sand and the seagull is

just on its head that's like trying to

get him off air that is trying to fish

but no one taught her how so yeah over

again and kind of look to see if Diaz

notices to give her a good job or not

I'll get this out in the water he's in

the water

I mean from the water though you can see

NAT on the shore casting the line yeah

oh he sees yeah yeah yeah I still don't

think we should try to find this dragon

at all it's if it's harmless we should

just leave it alone I thought we were

trying to enjoy our time at the beach we

are enjoying it we're swimming now the

two are swimming damn it there was no

dragon I did get you out in the water

all right you're right well then you

might as well make the best of it in DME

like dives right back underwater and

starts swimming around trying to find

underwater treasures damn it okay he

comes like cut away come back up after a

little bit see you strikes like oh come

on oh I mean I can't swim like that so

I'm just gonna turn myself back into a

pain

penguin down there okay so the pink ones

back all right

and the penguin starts swimming

underwater looking for stuff they passed

some schools of fish and as they get

closer to the reef they see all kinds of

dazzling colors you can see some it

looks like some of the coral has been

picked probably by traders there's a lot

of white and pink Coral still left there

are sand dollars and urgence and other

things that you stumble upon like to

imagine while they're swimming they're

like pointing things out to each other

his hand and it's tricks with yep he'll

definitely pick up a sand dollar with

the her beak and just like break it -

I'm like thinking it's money yeah all

right well that's going on palton what

are you up to am I still conscious

that's a good question make a

constitution saving for okay 14 yeah

you're still conscious all right

I don't know I'm stumbling around who do

i who do I see you see more you see

Warrington in his uniform

looking with his spyglass and he seems

to be talking to himself and then you

see NAT on the shore casting a line you

see squiggly with a horse sitting on top

of him

you see Jenks under a parasol with a

coconut drink and a book opened in his

lap and you see waffles covered with

seagulls and she's just lying there kind

of on her side now and all these

seagulls are just perched on her like a

dead whale occasionally she just sort of

flails and bass him around but they just

land on her again boom just kind of like

scans each of these scenarios like no he

sees sees James he's like ah yes they

like kind of stumbles over and like

squats down he goes little magic woman

why are you putting on an accent the

coat and it's

there's a stick you wouldn't get it

you've probably never seen where'd you

get the coconut oh this I don't know if

it was Strix as I am I stole it from her

room it's not here no because I he's

holding a balalaika because I want this

dad dad you here Simon

calling boys just like what are they

rabble it's lovely son tell your mother

[Laughter]

you smell really bad so I'm just gonna

give you this this here you take it

you are a saint and you will be reviewed

as the greatest wizard in the house

don't that's drinks I think I'd be the

only one in the house she's explained

that to me multiple times

no only wizard in the house well thank

you you're always heard drinks thank you

sip on his coconut piña colada yeah

there's a little wine in it though there

was just water in there so just water

all right yeah

so you just watered down your wine yep

but it's coconut water right yes sure

it's tasty loconut flavored water yeah

there's no new drinks just stumbles away

try to find Simon now see thanks his

roll girls as Isaac goes back to reading

and he's using the book as like a

sunshield

when you gaze over to Simon you see that

he has built a gigantic replica of

Castle Ravenloft Oh God cool out of sand

it's actually it's actually as tall tall

if not a little bit taller than he is

it's got the two big spires in the big

wall it was it's actually quite an

amazing bit of work for a pretty

impressive yeah yeah

it's like really like to like to scale

like impressive details mm-hmm just like

how long have we been on this beach

[Laughter]

Express digitated away it reminds me

home well what kind of home

sort of yeah it reminds me at home - oh

that's are we ever gonna go back there

oh that's real concerning yeah I'm like

you know what knowing I don't know it's

up to Perkins so probably at some point

but who knows son only time will tell

but this feels really foreshadowing so a

and he starts like pointing out things

he's like and that's where I almost did

stuff with a vampire that's where a bird

friend memories save my life that's

where me and I think that's where me and

he has shared a body once that was weird

it's just like pointing out all these

horrible things

Simon's just listening attentively mmm

that's and they just like passes out

straightforward Simon so taps him with a

stick I don't know why but I badged at

this point Evelyn's like all disheveled

because she's trying to make everyone

have fun oh yeah she's fixing from

drowning wreaths reading Nats line

patting her on the shoulder getting

another coconut for Jenks thanks is

lectures you've seen evil in Strix or DF

Bob up occasionally in the water to get

another gulp of air before diving back

down there they're quite far out

hundreds of yards out now but they seem

to be having a good time

Strix is doing fun penguin air

acrobatics and like jumping out a lot

like we like a whale but I think nice

it's real dumb and I mean I'm not gonna

play your characters but when someone

passes on the beach it is customary to

bury them in sand so yeah I think Simon

and hand-drew have got that

good yes so they're bearing paltin alive

in the sand yay great and and evil and

you can see a Warrington mont is still

kind of looking with his telescopic

spyglass over at the city and kind of

moving about looking at different things

anything on the horizon sir you you can

hear him kind of mumbling talking but he

doesn't seem to be talking loud enough

for anybody but himself to hear even

we'll go over and check on him just to

make sure he doesn't have some stroke

okay well he is clearly having what

appears to be a fairly low-key

conversation surprising for him with

nobody he's saying oh yes I could see

over there yes seems rather lightly

defended that tower I count one two

three oh four guards

oh yes they've got the Seewald and the

seawall change down there must be a lot

of traffic oh yes look at all those

pennants beautiful

well if yes there's one road that goes

up to the castle there's only one it's

like he's having a he's having a

conversation with somebody who is not

there Warren are you talking to someone

invisible what what no of course not

were you talking to me sorry I sometimes

I get confused when someone's like

talking to themselves or whether they're

talking to me or not he says not exactly

and it's it's all rather strange I seem

to have made telepathic contact with

someone in the city who wants to know

more about it do you know

nobody's quite friendly why does he want

to know more about the city I think he

finds it all very fascinating I get the

impression that is from some distant

land and he's specifically asking about

city defenses and things well know just

sort of well yes and other things of

course very curious wants to know what

it's like to live in the city and I tell

it it's wonderful beautiful place

friendly people not quick to judge

interesting you know I've had some

experience with this whole telepathic

connection thing and have you now I mean

among us we have and I'd be a little

worried about just kind of letting

anyone talk to you and tell you things

well he's not telling me anything I'm

just describing the city to him okay

okay

I'm sure that's fine I'm sure you know

you must have met someone real genuine

and you have a real connection and maybe

you can just be friends and that's nice

so kind of like a pen pal except with

your brain I agree yeah I'm sure that's

totally fine you should tell him about

what they endured oh yes

yes I shall you know tell him all about

the spires you could take him on a

little tour there hmm

capital yeah well I'm glad you're having

a good time too what's his name well oh

I don't know can you ask him well I did

ask him once but he said it was nyan

pronounceable well I'll just call him

neither that's a great name okay tell me

that I said hello and that I hope the

morning Lord shines upon him I will and

and evylyn yeah I'm having a splendid

time oh I'm so glad

let's do this what we should do this

like a monthly outing or something oh

yes of course I could care good

have fun with now I'll be right over

there if you need anything okay well if

I'm so glad you were the one to try and

talk to him yeah that's probably fine

why do we why would there be any reason

to suspect anything else so what next

I don't matter does anything killing us

in the water yet nope

I've imagined we'd actually probably

never turned back to shore yeah that

counted

yes gets tired really easily yeah and

you were you were struck by all the

things that you saw down there the sea

life you saw an octopus a small one Oh

around that changed color strix

definitely was pointing at that like

yeah flippers yeah but nothing hostile

everything was pretty that everything

was pretty tame down there yeah come

back to the shore with like uh oh you

did find actually sort of half buried in

the sand would look like an old bronze

Bell like maybe it was on a ship or

something it's about maybe a weighs

about 30 pounds and then it's just sort

of sunk in the sand that's neat

I don't think I would be able to bring

that back to the surface no you don't

think it would be that hard actually oh

I'm gonna do that okay and strix can

turn back into herself and help - sure

so she'll not on a penguin so you come

back could you come back to shore rejoin

your friends with this bronze Bell that

you found you can see there's it was

probably it doesn't seem to have a lot

of like barnacle growth or anything on

it so maybe it fell off a ship you know

within the last couple months or

something oh yeah I dig it with my staff

team nice nice solid tone this is so

cool what'd you find

fun about maybe we should have a bell

tower at the Waffle House and we can

ring it when the pies are ready and

it'll be like our thing for our our

business and they'll summon people to

the pies sure you do have a turret yeah

it looks like it came from the bow of

the ship so we can try to figure out

what ship it came from there's probably

like a lot of relief actually

in history here that sounds also

interested Abel Strix leans into Western

look he's having fun that's true

Wow what interesting history I wonder

what clues we could find right now here

on this beach on this fun vacation day

Matt roll a d20 for me sixteen you catch

a big fish

mama now runs over without taking it off

the pole cuz she doesn't know how to do

that she's just a little boy going yeah

it holds it up too dear

yeah do you see her coming he's like oh

my gosh it's like he's impressed by the

catch and put the bell down for just a

moment go over to net and like grab the

end of the line to help study the fish

he doesn't take it off for her usually

holds it to her and shows her how to

like you know smooth down the back of

the gills or the fins and actually like

unhook it to like you know probably like

take it off it just shows her how to

like take care of her like a first big

catch oh it's a first but better does he

teach her how to like cut it and

everything we can that's that could be

for later depends how late into the

evening we stay on this beat up but it's

a good eatin fish you know that DF yeah

that's dinner

yeah now will basically take as much

time as you will give her to teach her

this process and spend time with her

over it so oh sure and you're here

you're actually quite impressed that she

was able to pull it out of the water

because it's about a third her size yeah

net bring her dagger with her okay so

then yeah at some point he'll actually

have use her dagger to help show her how

to properly scale a fish and then were

to get like where the proper fillets

like the proper amount on me in the

voiding bone as soon as they do finish

this she definitely like chest out you

know very proud brings it over to Strix

and science kitchen lady and yeah

I'm not I'm not the kitchen lady I'm not

far though I know but that's

wait I don't know what to do with the

fish as a dad but he's already gutted

it's dinner yeah thank you it's all it's

all ready if she already prepared okay

all right so she strikes we'll take it

and look around and notice that there's

nothing to cook it on and just use her

hands and fire bells to just hold the

fish in her hands and cook it she's just

holding and she's like like sighing just

could not who knows nothing about

cooking thinks this is totally the only

way that you cook right and so like toss

it and flip it around she remembers that

halfway through and she's like this was

funnier but that's okay you can fillet

the fish and cook the fillets on the

frying pan hit it the same way with your

hands exactly she's gonna heat cook the

fish in the frying pan

all right this wonderful smell sort of

pervades the camp as the fish is fried

up beautifully by this time all of you

have noticed Simon's castle Ravenloft

sand castle and you can see just Paul

Tain's head sticking up out of the sand

with I can i press - did you take the

castle Ravenloft to turn into just the

the waffle house like whoa you don't

really have that fine control over the

spell okay if you press it it probably

says it all collapse I don't I don't

want to ruin it I feel better okay

that's very nice Simon that's great it's

a great reminder of accurate really bad

times I mean okay he'll come oh he'll

come over and eat some fish yeah it just

stands beside strix who's preparing the

fish and just kind of like looks like

yes you're welcome we'll sign here like

it's it's an excellent fish good job by

the time you eat the fish and the the

out the hours of the after it because

you got the late start of course the

hours of the afternoon tick away and the

Sun glides across the sky and is now

falling more over toward the west and

takes on that that look of that

weariness that the Sun gets when it

ready to set and the long shadows of the

castle walls on the island begin to span

across the sands a number of other

people have already taken their small

boats and gone back but you guys have

been having such a great time you've

just could have lost track and paltin is

still in the sand but at this time

paltin go ahead and roll a die for me

thirteen you wake up looks around so

it's like is it like yeah yeah just look

around like everybody else is sort of

over in a cluster they've eaten you can

sort of smell just a little hint of the

fish still in the air it's kind of what

this little crab crawls right up to your

face you scare it off and it goes off

hey hi Devon Castle Ravenloft the shadow

by the way the shadow of the the sand

castle has now fallen on top of you so

when you look up it's just this

silhouette of Castle Ravenloft loo

looming high above you we should go hey

guys

help oh no get him out you don't have to

do it all right as a good time the jokes

over

NAT jank squiggly let my paltin out

thanks is like it wasn't B when you see

that he was set up he's set Ferdinand up

next to him also with a Sun shield

yeah great

squiggly still like passed out just

exhausted

flopping yes and and so yes Simon will

end will go over if no one else will

well even will go over and but she like

despite herself she kind of like pauses

for a second she's like oh you you want

out of the sand

Simon Simon Simon just darts his eyes

for Evelyn to you evil to you this whole

conversation don't don't make this a

thing it doesn't need to be a thing I

just I would like to get what happened

can you if you're not gonna help me out

can you just like hand me can you like

get me one of my wines and like a really

long straw and I'll be fine Simon what

happened to your father here he shrugs

her shoulders like he's lost his voice

all of a sudden do you think we should

help him give us a puckish smile I will

expend a spell slot for this he takes

his bucket what's it over Paulin said

when Simon runs away all right even

takes the bucket off and she digs around

a little yeah okay at this point in

faulting you to pull yourself out great

it's like a cool now there's sand

everywhere and it's gonna be there for

months when you drink that much wine on

the beach it is now that I've written it

down alright um did you tell them to

make this castle rave mocked oh yeah

no Simon's a little homesick mm-hmm the

Waffle House I'm hoping

except the castles like I'm gonna say no

well maybe maybe we need to make him a

more comfortable place at the Waffle

House that he'll love even more than

Castle Ravenloft

maybe we haven't been doing a good job

of you know yeah I'd say if he misses

this then we're probably doing something

wrong

mmm okay well maybe he needs a new room

maybe he needs a room all to himself

do we have he has a turret room before

and he's had he sleeps in Paul's room

you think he needs his own room he might

he might be at that age

yeah okay well maybe we could maybe oh

we could make him his own room and I can

paint it like castle castle Ravenloft so

you can have his little thing it's just

a phase is going just here no above game

I just want my room to look like that to

be honest okay that's an idea I mean I

don't know what a jacket is supposed to

have their own room cuz I never had my

own room and also I don't really

understand how to parent at someone who

is 80 and also like eight at the same

time it's very confusing so yeah it's a

weird window maybe we bear enough well

maybe we'll just talk to him and see see

what what we could do why not now Simon

oh he's over with the other kids

dad come here he comes

why'd you make a castle Ravenloft it's

very nice by the way very accurate yeah

mm-hmm was it like you miss it there

just like you remember it real well I

just I is this is this what the teenager

phase where you just don't say anything

anymore you don't like to talk anymore

to your parents

it's just a dumb castle okay well don't

say it's dumb it's very nice it's very

well done

you know also do you you have a real

talent for this maybe you want to take

up some more sculpture or like

architecture we can help you know

support your interests like good parents

sure cool um also do you feel like you

need your own room

yeah oh okay well let's see what we can

do about that is there anything else you

want to tell us anything on your mind

can we make it up like a pirate then

sure that sounds much better

I'm gonna be a pirate oh okay someone

your age that sounds awesome

any waters off hey guys

I'm gonna be a pirate I think we did

that well that was good right I think

that was good yeah pirates are cool when

they're not trying to kill us okay good

talk

good job get a little like parenting

high-five

constrict see that Warrington is still

talking to himself no he's not talking

to himself he's sort of cleaning off his

monocle and it looks like looks like

he's he's grown impatient he wants to

get home but he hasn't hasn't told

anybody that he just feel okay

I'm sure storks can feel it she's very

aware of everyone when they're just

uncomfortable comes back from the ocean

even will be like Strix have you ever

heard of someone being able to just talk

telepathically across planes even though

their planes and stuff drinks just makes

this face what have I heard of that I'm

gonna shut I'll do an arc on a check

I'll see if I've heard of that cuz I

have a pen pal you know woman but

Warrington has like a mind pin palette

oh that sounds like a bad thing I got 18

no you've never heard of anything like

that

well you should I don't like it

his name's nah I don't it's probably not

his name

blew something bad but you know what I'm

gonna go ask him about what that map

that he was drawing on the floor cuz I

was weird so I'm gonna stomp over to him

real quick and just be like hey

Warrington hey you know what I don't

like about this Beach we're gonna leave

the beach soon I just what was the map

like about this Beach the only thing

it's missing is a good mud bath next

time we should go to the mud flats cute

that's adorable are we heading back now

yes we are XS I totally Strix totally

forgot her question because she just

thinks it's funny

until he'll help pack things up in the

boats come on kids

we're heading back exhausted then we all

have so much fun shouldn't we do this

all the time mister cause like if Simon

isn't looking Strix is 100% gonna go

like kick the castle over last thing you

do is you run out Castle yeah yeah not

asking what what fun thing did evil in

do the care of it alright just make it

to run the same page here yeah as you

cross the deepwater Harbor you make it

back to the dock Ward you put the ships

back tie them up at the pier you haul

your stuff out strap it back on to the

albear you get Lance you stuff up his

cart with what remains of empty bottles

apart from the ones you probably left on

the beach and make your way back to the

Waffle House when you get it's a it's a

nice drive back there it's a warm

evening the Sun is setting behind the

walls of the city so everything is sort

of shadowy and cool just slants of light

coming through at various points onto

the street until you make your way into

troll skel alley Park Lance begin to

take things down

off the albear the kids run and run to

the front door and notice that there

when you get inside there is a note on

the counter from the Chickenfoot coven

telling you that you know business went

smoothly today nothing to worry about

there two packages or two packages

arrived one is a letter addressed to the

waffle crew in a red envelope and the

other is a long box that was mistakenly

delivered and you can see it is actually

addressed to someone named Audra Nell

you know that a letter came goes was it

from yeah it says it says Audra no

trolls go Ali now you don't know an

Audra now on troll skull Ellie alright

well we can't open it because it's

someone else's mail so we'll we'll find

them why we should make sure that we

seal it back up so you could never tell

no what's the letter

evylyn do you want to read the letter

out loud to us someone knows our name

and put things in a red letter which I

feel like red isn't it it has a danger

color yeah I'll read it out loud okay

when you open the letter you see that it

is an invitation to attend an auction Oh

an invitation oh it's for that auction

thing that was part of our plan on the

devil worshippers it tells you where and

when it's easy to bring up the auction

that's Wendy Athena B's like that's what

I was trying to figure out today oh my

god I completely forgot we had fun

fix like holds up some sand dollars like

throws them the beach is swimming you

had fun did you have like panicking like

starting like pick up all of his stuff

he's like I can't believe I just let

myself out my god he like starts like

going upstairs stuff to his room do you

think he'll ever have fun today after a

few minutes of night I mean like just

like a brief moment after like him

getting to the top of the stairs

yeah actually comes down a little bit

like coax his head through the railing

just says you guys right though today it

was nice and I think we all needed that

hey I like hanging out with you guys

I was good it was good see he had fun

even puts the invitation on whatever is

the equivalent of the fridge okay goes

into the kitchen and basically puts it

on top of the ice the icebox we have a

bowl I think you're in the kitchen we

have like a bulletin board that says

like wash your hands no sir like this is

establishment isn't responsible for

injuries yeah what do you do with the

package the box - Audra Nell

well we open it of course excellent

their districts are not - oh right of

course

yeah palton opens it alright you just

using like a knife or something that cut

it open yeah I try to be like elekid to

where this will be like it's it's kind

of it's sort of square on the ends but

it's long and so when you slice it you

want to slice it at the top so that you

can just sort of dump it out from the

top you want to slice it along the side

which way would be like more delicate

probably the top all right let's go with

the side I know you're gonna say that

you slice it open on the side and you

open it up and you can see that it

contains a rolled-up rug looks quite

beautiful just an exquisite rug rolled

up in a tube like a bundle like a

cylinder it's a rug and then the rug

leaps out and attacks you no no the

reich's fighting me am I the only one in

the room yes you're the only one in the

room

Oh God the rugs fighting me the rug is

fighting me we have a we have this rogue

rug what's what's the color code for

this current it makes it it makes an

attack against you oh my god I roll the

crit will be a rug so you are grappled

by the rug and so it completely wraps

around you and until the grapple ends

you are restrained blinded and

suffocating

all right great

and so roll initiative paltin in my head

I like might I'm trying to be more kind

to myself but my guilt is telling me

that somehow I might have deserved this

that is a gnat one okay all right so at

the start at the start of your turn you

take 11 bludgeoning damage as it starts

constricting you and crushing you to

death

cool oh boy and what do you do you're

restrained blinded grappled did any of

us hear the commotion nope no one heard

me scream the rug is attacking me mm-hmm

there's a lot of noise the kids are

screaming they're wound up so I plus

nobody takes you seriously when you say

the rug is attacking you guys drunk he's

past that again so then I can't I can't

even cast any spells can I so while your

verbal spells you can't cast because you

are you can't breathe thunder wave a rug

so and of course you know you're you're

absolutely wrapped up in this thing so

no it's got verbal and somatic

components both of which are very

difficult for you okay I wish this said

what with oh wait come over but okay

cool all right

verbal somatic cool somatic cool verbal

somatic verbal somatic yeah you're not

gonna really find a spell where it

doesn't good um so I'm wrapped up am I

still like on my feet at least did it

just like yeah you might actually be

kind of stumbling around a little bit on

your feet okay I'm just gonna run

straight forward okay until I hit

something okay

all right the rest of you hear the sound

of crashing glass as he runs into the

the pastry display case we come running

and again Paul can you take six points

of damage fool and yes you can hear the

sound of crashing glass downstairs we're

up here we'll go downstairs but he does

that thing where you know at the end of

the beach day he's still in his swim

trunks and only put on like one shirt

all right so you got like his like

leather vest comes downstairs and then

yeah excellent you see Paul tin your

speed becomes zero when you fall over

but we are basically lying down flailing

on the ground and you take another let

you take another 10 points of damage as

DF comes down the stairs and C's palton

wrapped up in a rug an open box near him

broken shards of glass from the pastry

counter he walked into his feet or just

out of the bomb like flailing your

muffled screaming you serious right now

like it's something else coming out of

the sewer Oh

click your feet twice if this is serious

easiest stop is just like and that's

where we'll stop I like him nothing bad

happened and we were all so scared if

something bad happens and this rug is

kicking my ass

gatherings if you're like any of that

stuff come on by and a lot of things

happen today well I've really

fascinating moments I'm sure you just

want to discuss and only there was a

place you could go to do the an art of I

know in all the places of the Internet

it just seems like the one thing you

could really get is something like a uh

subreddit they can go to right now to

join another discussion for all these

dice camera action a lot of really good

theories on it that I've been really

enjoying lately they went through the

entire list of

everyone who's in love with evylyn

that's right yeah I'm feel like the

people are talking like the most

memorable moments throughout all of dice

camera action there's a really good

discussion going on about the moral

compass of every character which is

really really fascinating to me and all

that stuff and more and you can join in

on it

so should you need a link I Jared I

believe that you should because

repeatedly that URL link I don't even

know what buttons you push to do that

alright and so that's a wrap for this
