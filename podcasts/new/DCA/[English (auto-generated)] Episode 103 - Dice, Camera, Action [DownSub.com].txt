me welcome to dice camera action whoo

yeah so we played D&D for fun

although sometimes what sometimes you

have to kind of find the fun

when does the fun start yeah exactly

thank you Anna you're welcome you're my

favorite having fun too all right before

I jump into the recap first of all I

just want to say hello to our guest star

Brooks thank you for joining us my man

hi guys so folks will be playing a

surprise person he'll be playing a

surprise character that will show up

soonish and until then he can just watch

us pick up where we left off last week

so the waffle crew arrived in Waterdeep

the city of splendors and not long after

their arrival they sort of heard through

Zent arum agents that the center

operating in the city were at war with

the zenith our guild a criminal

syndicate operating in the city's

underworld apparently there was some

sort of alliance that was trying to be

forged and it all kind of fell to pieces

and things went to but the waffle

crew quickly became embroiled in this

conflict when guilt by association they

were caught with some Zant arm folks and

as an authorial jumped them over the

course of several encounters the waffle

crew has brushed up against the zenith

our guild killing a mind flare in a

guild killing one of their assassins in

the guild and also causing other sorts

of trouble

more recently agents of the zenith our

guild

snuck into the Waffle House while the

crew was distracted and stole waffles

the albear a wizard basically

polymorphed her into a fish and then

disguised as a woman with her husband

and baby in a carriage made their way

back to a secret base in the sewers

underwater deep where the fish turned

back into the albear was trapped in a

cage only to be freed by three street or

Asians named NAT Jenks and squidly and a

little misadventure occurred and then

adventure occurred and then a brief

chase occurred through the streets until

waffles reunited with the waffle crew

and with these three children basically

riding on her back the wizard the Santa

thar guild wizard in pursuit was stopped

and caught by DF and the city watch

and her goblin retinue were also

captured now the city watch is basically

convened on the scene and there are lots

of spectators around DF Strix

evylyn paltin you are confronted by

waffles in these three children

waffles does not look any worse for wear

but looks tired having run a great

distance at full oh yeah girl and the

kids just sort of come tumbling off her

back what did you make friends oh thing

you know they're not a gross yeah and so

waffles goes over to Strix

and gives her a big salty lick and I'm

better yeah and you can see that she's

she's she's panting and nervous yeah

well when she's been running for for a

long time yep okay I can't sweat a a

watch sergeant a middle-aged woman sort

of comes over and takes command of the

situation you can see all the goblins

have been apprehended and are already

being carted off the street d/f you

caught the invisible wizard trying to

get away

yes drops her invisibility oh good and

you can see that she's wearing kind of a

dirty gown she's her curly red long hair

is all disheveled and kind of

taking out in weird directions and she's

even got like a fleck of a piece of

garbage stuck in it from I guess where

she was barreling down an alley or

something okay but she hasn't taken

notice of it Hey immediately do I notice

anything recognizable about her outfit

say Zenith ours and taro related no in

fact it kind of looks like a stained

wedding gown

that's right that's been worn too long

and on too many occasions and has become

discolored frayed and torn okay so I

guess it is completely inappropriate for

this situation yeah so still holding on

to her and I guess all other bids okay

still holding on to her and the putting

the other hand onto the pommel of moon

splinter yeah deaath will say you tried

to take something away from us and then

we'll I guess kind of mover or if she

said the City Guard was coming so he's

gonna drag her everywhere yeah so he's

kind of like kind of hold on to her so

that when the City Guard comes he can be

like arrest this woman yes okay and

that's what they do they take her into

custody

yeah and you could just pointed people

and I've never seen that before

usually if we pointed people we get

arrested palms like trying to test that

he's like it's not working quite so well

[Laughter]

comes over to you and says to the woman

that you've captured DF well well

tarnisha arpel and out in the day no

less and on the street no less

and she says what trouble have you

gotten into now

and she says well I don't know who you

are I don't trouble myself to remember

the name of common rabble but I was just

riding my coach down the street albeit

at a fast pace and I regret that now but

I'm not guilty of any crime oh my gosh

excuse me but where are you from she

says to you I'm from long saddle

my family has a astounding reputation

there do I know where long saddle is it

is a small ranch town far to the north

of Waterdeep deep in the disor in the

valley is it anywhere near my hometown

mm-hmm oh my gosh longs at all I've I

totally was there for you know are like

paladin high school field trip in fact

when you hear that her last name is harp

he'll you know you know the heart pal

family they're very very well known

wizardry and magic runs strong in that

family and they have a large state much

it's actually as big as long saddle

itself just outside of the town proper

oh my gosh with the horse ranch that's

right

oh I totally had like three horses from

you guys

Yulin now's not the time why dad did

turns back to partnership and said and

also towards like the city of Washington

yeah

well it's either one of two things then

either kidnapped our owl bear or you've

been terrorizing these children which is

it all right did she tear as you myself

what does that the leader of the

children say in response or do in

response that looks at squiggly and jinx

jinx school ian jenks and is like what

is this crazy woman saying squiggly is

just like i got it in turn is just like

it's cool she took that that fish that

was turned into a thing but we we saved

it and we saved day

and we're awesome and we kicked some

crazy ass and it was great

oh my gosh you are awesome watch your

language though yeah we're heroes we

saved that we saved the owl bear and you

know like wave is old pop it up it's a

fish pernicious says I have no need for

an Al bear nor would I ever associate

with one they are my oysters pure and

simple

they're put in a cage you did what I

didn't no such thing but but you did why

are you lying you're a little horned

liar are you well says the sergeant I

believe we have enough to hold her on

but if she did indeed steal this beast

from you which I'm sure is licensed and

so on and so forth yes then that is a

crime in the city and she must be held

to account the children will need to as

witnesses testify against her once her

court date is sent until then she will

be contained in accommodations within

Castle water deeps dungeon we have cells

there that our wizard proof I can think

of no greater punishment I can and

pernicious says testify against me for

no crime whatsoever well if you did feel

our albear then absolutely did not I am

guiltless of this crime squigglies like

yeah you did and you can you can

see the sergeant come over to you

squiggly and just say do not talk like

that on the street young man very trying

to Brenda sure sure

and then parnisha being carried off just

sort of turns to you squiggly and matt

and jinx and sort of gives you a look

that you kind of expect like a king

cobra to give you and then she says

testify against me i find that very

interesting and I'm sure my solicitor

will as well

very interesting solicitor so uh so what

I'm so scared I'm just like playing yeah

and then she giving you all the evil eye

gets waltzed off I that makes all manner

of rude faces at her all right since

most of you don't have any information

the the guards they take the names of

the kids but they don't spend the kids

are basically allowed to stay with you

the sergeant will say before parting

that parnisha has dubious associations

in the city and if they can get her on a

serious crime that would be pretty huge

for the city watch

so she says keep the kids safe damn can

we keep him Evelyn's already like on her

knees talkie for the kids like I'm

evylyn what's your name she's goes to

squiggly what's your name don't you get

some homes no what is that like under

the bridge okay you two she points the

other day

and they beta had homes right oh you

don't I don't

we know that jinx had a home right

acceptors believe so but whether or not

he actually tells you that is entirely

up to you Holly

yeah Matt says no we're adventures no

I'm not a wizard but I can cast spells

once in a while

Wow can you cast spells I can you look

like a mighty wizard to me like waves as

one sees whatever he say is oh that's

very good

circus is like can you bake pies all of

them that's like no the sergeant will

take you aside death and just say no

seriously they'll need to be taken care

of and that's sort of that's kind of

that's that's beyond the purview of the

city watch but as I said this is

important and pernicious is rumored to

have criminal underworld contact so we

don't know what will happen once word of

her capture spreads good responsible

deer

let's say understood we can do our best

you to keep them in our care or find the

proper people that can keep them safe

death will kind of give them brief

information on where to find their

manner so that should the city watch a

great plan Sam again and the city watch

captain also gives you her name although

she is stationed in the trades Ward you

can basically reach out to her through

any watch post and her name is sergeant

Kelly Donna

all right Kelly Donna yep Elise Kelly

Donna okay and as she's telling you her

name make an inside check sure I'll do

that using my new character she's 11

death warning the children

[Laughter]

I have to keep it up every day one for

you one for you for you I got a good

insight at 22 okay you believe very

subtly and with a considerable amount of

tact that she's kind of hitting on you

oh hell oh yeah very professional though

I mean it's just that there's an

undercurrent of magnetism she hot before

you become completely incoherent she

goes off and make sure that the goblins

and their wizard gets sent where they

should okay

turns back towards the rest of the party

and the children yeah and as he's like

walking towards them he's just kind of

muttering to himself just like it's

business just business relationship

purely professional

I mean why just did Strix see that you

were too busy casting death wards on the

kids I think even is trying to learn

sign language from that and that is like

reluctantly teaching her a few things

like she's showing she's showing even

the name signs for each of the kids and

then evylyn is asking her if she can

have a name sign yet and that is like

not yet I don't know you for net then

her sign language is it is it Pierre

sign language or is there perhaps a

little bit of like thieves can't

symbolism in there well I was imagining

that it's it's watered avian street sign

so I imagine that could be influenced by

I think there's probably some class over

yeah

okay so which is compensating for the

fact that I don't actually know ASL I

just know a few things and I'm using

like a mix of street sign that I

actually know and there's the answer to

your question everyone who constantly

asks in chat it's some ASL and some

indian street sign and some things I'm

making up which is exactly right because

languages kind of self made out of

things she's picked up yeah the DF could

pick up on a few things and like someone

had just taken freshman year of high

school foreign language course mm-hmm I

will be able to communicate right okay

DFO kind of go up in kind of takes a

needs down next to the children and

actually will ask them do any of you

have a home to go to and as he's saying

this and he's making the hand gestures

that you were just struck by his fluency

yeah his his artfulness in making these

subtle gestures but it's not it so you

know it's not fully sign I just know

he's can't as well you don't know

thieves can't mmm because you're not a

rogue but having been a rat on the

street and around rogues many of these

symbols and things that you've

incorporated are things that you've seen

shot back and forth between roguish

types and so you pick up on stuff she is

like super impressed by this

and her eyes kind of get like heart hurt

he a little bit and she's like I think

he's the leader she just called you a

loser you probably know that's not true

yet it's close though the sign is very

similar I'm pretty sure pretty sure

that's it none of them answered the

question oh not as two lovestruck yeah

squiggly as to she points that squiggly

she's like he's bad at that sign

language no I'm not hungry thank you

[Music]

[Laughter]

dear well then just say well you guys

the three of you were true heroes today

you say which are ro-bear waffles just

the sweetest girl fish and okay

everyone's gonna bring her home and we

want to thank you for that so we would

love to and bye

- back to our home where you can play

with waffles and pet her Strix over here

can make you some delicious pies and who

knows maybe she can also teach you some

magic you teach your magic you want to

learn magic and I'm sure James is like

yeah I do I don't have a house all right

and then like back gift is like just

leaves candy just like just stay with us

we'll keep you safe okay

paulten like kind of a tax follow

encounter walks up to squiggly and like

kneels down mm-hmm and you just kind of

squint at them like like examining gum

and then like Simon appears out of

palton shadow and over and squints at

him as well well like fallen just puts a

hand on Simon's head is just like it's

like it's okay he's like he's like

examining on me just like same player

two characters and squigglies just like

what nothing don't worry about it you

wouldn't understand

does these these kids don't happen to be

ones that Simon played with before right

uh no no one knows right

so Jenks you're probably just sort of

marveling when you see this little

puppet boy falling on one of them around

that pulls her sword out she's she's not

sure about Simon Simon wave at her give

deaath looks back to her and just

signals safe she nods begrudgingly and

then goes to stand next to dsi looking

very important all right like but like

too close

yeah yeah shoulder brushed against you

yeah she's like she's basically just

trying to be the Robin to your Batman

right now all right very good you prance

and saunter your way back to troll skull

alley

and to the Waffle House which is pretty

much as death left it

I am also keeping a very close eye on

Simon okay you probably haven't actually

kind of let go of his hand

uh-huh in this whole escapade yep and so

he's just following along hand-in-hand

this was like right after paltin just

went and found him right yeah because

you guys paltin rescued Simon and then

you got back to the house and you saw

the message stuck in the bar saying that

waffles wings and then from there you

just went out to try to find her as

quickly as possible okay so all of that

madness has like just finished we

haven't even talked about it yet so by

the time you get back to the house

you're kind of emotionally exhausted by

the experience but grateful that waffles

was found so readily and of course the

kids they see this ginormous kinda half

run down half repaired haunted house

like okay and there's ghosts yes and

then when he sees it he's just like and

and squigglies like I bet there's secret

doors

oh yeah the second he can squigglies

gonna like just try and like break off

and like investigate stuff okay Lance

has basically parked himself on one of

the porches and is just kind of hanging

out there chewing on probably like a

section a wooden wall or banister more

likely it's raining knowing on that

evylyn sorry NAT looks at the house and

looks at Dina that just they all eat oh

right yeah oh yeah yeah sorry NAT looks

at the house and she looks at Diaz and

she's like HQ yes dogs back at her she's

like sufficient days pass the kids

become more accustomed to the structure

they've sort of made their home here

there

to the unseen servants moving about with

brooms and such it provides no endless

amount of riotous laughter as the spiral

staircase goes up in the interior of the

tap room it becomes immediately popular

because of its spiraling railing that

allows squidly Jencks and not to

basically corkscrew down and I forgot to

when you get back to your room d-trix

left this for you you find that on your

bed and there's a little note and I can

read that I even actually I was gonna

send it but I'd have time but I can read

the note if you want to read the note

says dear dear I have my own room now

I felt bad though because I think you

get sad or scared when you can't make

sure I'm alive and on the dead book so I

made you this you can start me around

with you also you told me you want it at

once also I'm just downstairs book two

Strix and it's actually animated and it

just kind of shivers so you pick it up

and it starts to shiver you look back

and Strix has her own room deaath

actually like folds the paper back up

staring for a moment and looks over at

the doll and gently picks it up and just

kind of stares at it for like the

longest moment and tries to maintain

composure and his emotions right there

he goes to his attic closet opens it up

and then kneels down next to what looked

like a bunch of discarded things to

anyone else a bunch of blankets extra

pillows maybe clothes or something

pushes it all away and there's a small

private trunk and he actually takes his

lock picks unlocks it and opens it up

and inside there is a few other things

that dia has always kept there's

actually a piece of Canada robe from

Strix before burro via they has also got

in there couple over like funky weird

looking coins he's found over the things

that may be currency and death

cities like there's probably a point

port irons are real coin in there that's

also where he kept his DF doll as well

and he takes the Strix one and just

gently places it right next to the DF

one and puts the note between them okay

closes it back up and relax it alright

as the day's wear on spring there's it

sorry sorry I mean I think that even

would ask where Paulson found Simon

would that whole escapade God while DF

is up in his room or know just like

probably you know we just got back and

like Simon ran away after kidnapping you

did what oh wait I mean what I mean okay

well here's what happened to you

so Strix is like why what I mean we

fixed it it's fine I mean I I gave the

kid juniper so he's not gonna like bless

charges or anything

we fixed it because we blew off house I

mean I blew up I mean nothing happened

everyone back to their roots I mean but

the point is that Simon ran away and we

were very worried and I'm just I I don't

know don't we found uh many was and he

was fine and like you know it's every

there guys don't worry everything's okay

now right and no one's going to jail so

don't worry so after four days this is

how much of the story you get do you

roll it inside with the plus fifty

advantage and does not believe you and

looked sad

we'd probably tell it nope Alton's just

like explained it's like but it's good

it's all sorted out evil and can I talk

to you for

yeah great we have um things to discuss

don't mind us

justgo different even like looks at dia

thins tricks and she's like ah he's just

telling her in private he's like so when

I went to get Simon when he ran away um

[Music]

he he's he's also like I have Simon with

me like I am I'm just holding on to him

yeah she Pat's him he's uh he might be

going through some stuff um well he did

kidnap a kid he did kidnap a kid and it

was very bad Simon no he said don't yell

at him don't yell at him he doesn't need

that I'm not yelling he also kind of ran

out into a street and stood in front of

a carriage hoping it would run him over

what but it's okay I saved him I got my

other way and it was fine but then I

like landed him on a roof and then he

was kind of looking over the edge really

weird and I that made me really

uncomfortable and I think I think I

think he's in a bad place

you're good with like feelings what do

we do

she just kneels down and kind of like

tries to embrace Simon okay pull him in

close does he let her yeah yeah sort of

she's like Simon I'm so sorry I would

ask if you're okay but I know you're not

I'm so what I would ask what's going on

but you can't even can't even tell us

can you he doesn't move it's like he's

inanimate she looks up at paltin like

helplessly and then she's like huh

sign language Simon would you do you

want to learn sign language then you can

tell us what's wrong and we can help

he kind of shrugs in a way that suggests

maybe see you've already

it oh no Nate here's you glitched you

robot it out you how about it out say it

again say hello what Oh aye it's fine

it's fine

are we fine yeah we're fine we're good

okay uh so she she's just like kind of

like a little tears running down her

cheek but she's smiling like she's not

letting the mast down at all and she's

like don't worry we're gonna figure this

out and you're gonna stay safe and

Paulson's here for you and I'm here for

you and we're gonna listen and we're

gonna figure this out mm-hmm yeah that's

some language too

maybe that will give your name sign do

you want a name son what do you want

your name sign to be this is s she

taught me that he rolls his eyes that's

actually he looks around for a knife all

right Strix troll tide is coming up and

customarily inte roll tide

children run around in troll masks and

beg adults for treats and such and play

tricks if they don't get their promised

goodies this is Danny's favorite holiday

this happens happen this happens

throughout the day the adults celebrate

troll tide by erecting wicker effigies

of trolls life-sized trolls and lighting

them on fire

- basically commemorates the honey to

commemorate the end of the troll war

where trolls besieged the city and the

city beat them back and set them all

ablaze

so already made as many of these wicker

things as she can in front of the magic

well they're massive so there are city

ordinance as you discover when the when

the Gartland city watch come knocking

and say you can't actually build your

own they have to be built by the guilds

and then they're set up by the set up by

the city watch in designated places so

that the fires of the trolls don't

accidentally light the city ablaze so

but they are they do tell you they

tell you that they are gonna set one up

in troll skull alley which they don't

customarily do and they point to a

little sort of wide open area a little

bit off from your house that's where

they're gonna set it up they're gonna

put that up there and so you know you

can have that well I've already made two

of them outside of the mansion by myself

they say that to me and I'm sure it

looks like they're like scolding me I'm

just like all right and as soon as they

turn around

I just animate them and I block them

over to where they're supposed to be

okay that kind of freaks them out yeah

don't do that but they will take them

away or assure them away whatever is

easier and so that they can set those up

if not here in other places and they

thank you so you you probably dress up

the house in whatever you believe is

appropriate that look like razor vine

and everywhere is there um I mean like

someone has to answer the door to give

treats to the kids right yeah or they

sit outside on the steps or Stoops or

even opens the door with flourish and

she's like happy roll tide and she's

dressed as Strix like still clean yeah

it's like a super clean version of Strix

and it even has like flowers in it but

they're like black and gray flowers

somehow she like dunked them in

something

what do you pull in the whole world I

can't tell what you're supposed to

that's not a troll it's I'll give you a

clue um I am super kind and beloved by

my friends and um I am very strong and I

like hats

so you're evil at various points tricks

you are and every all of you were

distracted by the kids who need help

creating their troll masks and such and

they're probably running around the

house with those things on days before

actual troll tide rolls around

absolutely she's also she's made one for

everyone in the party too and she like

poignant ly like when Diaz leaves it

places on purpose cuz he doesn't want to

have fun she like poignant Lea bring it

back don't be like you laughing over

here he was just running around in the

background being like I know he's just

like are we doing costumes yes BRB any

like runs upstairs and once Trix has

made all kinds of little pies and things

to give out to the kids great tiny here

pies by now Simon probably has a troll

mask too and is kind of running around

with the children adorable is he friends

with NAT and squiggly yeah he's probably

just starting to learn little bits of

sign language and kind of getting a feel

for what they're like temperamentally

cool and Jenks likes having likes

pretending that the animated man is

under his command just waves his wife

waves his blond around does not I I

think NAT learns about the dart shooting

from Simon and I think I think that she

thinks that's really really cool well

actually Simon has never even revealed

that he has that ability

okay well never mind then you know and

you think it's probably because he's not

proud of it no well I was going to make

it part of his name sign so I want okay

never mind I'll have to think of

something okay and around noon the

weather takes a turn for the worse and

big thick clouds start to pour over from

the ocean and rain begins to douse the

city ah

troll types cancelled everyone yeah and

yeah but way my costume yeah cannot

contain his disappointment yes but your

cuts a costume

your costume paltin as you come running

down the stairs so paltin starts walking

down you just like now I know everyone

was probably expecting Strada but I got

something way better and he walks down

and he's wearing a like a brown leather

vest with like a long-sleeve shirt but

and also these like cool boots but it's

all like a little bit too tight and he's

like oh no I don't like I don't know

cages and dying close enough Diaz in the

corner of the table is like his arms

folded and she's like a hey

troll type she's like wraps her arms or

on Paulson's arm she's like we're best

friends forever like hugs our back it's

just like and there's nothing more to

that rain just starts pouring down

outside filling up the rain barrels

around the various buildings and

structures and stuff you realize your

building doesn't have any rain barrels

they were stolen long ago so rain is

just sort of gushing out all over the

place you also don't have the turret

quite finished or repaired yet so rain

is also pouring down through the inside

of your house and then DF as you are

wallowing in your misery you receive a

sending magical spell telepathically

enters your head and it says I mean look

at gutter this is a female voice sounds

dwarven and it says retaliatory Zanna

thar guild attack imminent don't try to

leave water deep sending our best agent

to protect you your ally history dawn of

the

antara me meanwhile faulting and evil

energy versus tricks you see also in the

kitchen there's like this empty pan that

had all these little pies on it and

they're all just gone I see who took

them

sure yeah you can follow the crumb trail

right to Jenks you can actually see that

Simon has part of a pie in his mouth

like Jenks is just sort of stuffed it in

there and he's just sort of chewing on

it a little bit just just next time just

to leave a couple more for everyone else

cuz if I don't give D at the pie and I

think he gets so sad that he just tries

to go into another dimension I also want

to add that during this time like

squidly kind of like hides behind chairs

and stuff and then like waits for the

invisible servants to like pick up cups

or something and then tries to use them

as target practice okay I'll teach you

real magic if you eat less of my pies oh

really all right as you're talking to

him this straight arrow goes through

your head just gets stuck there got it

yeah after receiving this ending I mean

the kind of like stand straight up out

of his chair starts looking around at

the windows and starts going up to

looking if there's ways to lock it and

or board it up the windows do have

latches on them and they have shutters

so you can pull them shut make a

perception check yeah he's gonna start

doing that just watching everything up

and closing it all down oh no because I

have a reliable Talent yes he won all

right as you are

taking care of the windows lashing them

up one of the front-facing windows that

looks out over the porch and over the

front of the mansion on the ground floor

one of the room one of the windows in

the tap room you as you are pulling that

shut you can see through the rain across

the alley which is quite wide standing

next to a rain barrel is a short cloaked

figure just in the rain just absolutely

drenched and it just goes heck and you

can see the hand is sort of a kind of a

scaly red the hand is a scaly red and

through the the cowl the rain cowl you

can see just the lower part of what

looks like a child's face a tiefling

child's face and this cleft lip yep yep

shudders and luck and shut that down and

front door and lock it

so until to go outside all right deep

basement hat just starts checking that

to see if like I'd still like safe and

mmhmm like a place to hide or whatever

yes it is we should close up the window

so watch out things might kill us again

like at this point

seeing the DF is closing the windows it

just starts going like doing it too and

panicking while they're still acting

this whole thing out why try to warn the

windows and join chalk lines on them and

just like drawing symbols and freaking

out okay beautiful then go to the dude

Jenks and NAT and squidly and just say

says his name is Simon Simon buries for

his hat yeah no that's I've been just

like a crude sign back base is saying

take care of them Strix and as a knock

on the tap room door doc closes that up

holds like a rug or blanket or something

to cover that up

squiggly was like about to like give a

cool speech to DFA immediately closes it

it's like I know you're the Lyra so DF

stands back up and turns towards the

others and just says is Anitha are here

for us bones like huh I'll go get my

good cape and he just goes scarecrow get

back up the stairs actually going to

cast I want to renew spells she's gonna

cast spirit Guardians

oh and giant chickens spectral chickens

are going to stand guarding the door

okay that was about 10 minutes if they

concentrate on the spell yes okay I'm

not only casting it at its normal third

level so sister nor I you have come upon

in the rain this mansion on troll skull

alley

it's it's

the corner of the alley you sort of

sculpt past a rain-drenched wicker troll

that was never lit you pass some rain

barrels that are overflowing and there

doesn't seem to be anybody in the alley

and a fog has kind of pushed its way in

to the area cloaking your arrival and as

you look at the house you see it's

basically four stories with tall peaked

attics and a five-story turret on the

corner the top of the turret seems to be

missing its roof it's just sort of this

jagged frayed edge open to the rain you

imagine that can't be good

but and there's some activity inside

because you see shutters closing and

drapes being pulled and all kinds of

things light being blocked out one

window at a time what do you do so

Neriah is going to wait carefully not

necessarily out of view but making

herself inconspicuous you know a

passerby a stay you know just a water

Davian enjoying troll tide or just

observing troll time and is going to

wait until it seems as though action in

the house has has ceased okay you see

the house gets shut up

as tight as it could okay in that case

knowing what I already know and do ice

is there anyone on the front porch make

a perception check I will do that

I rolled an 18 plus eight is it's gonna

be 26 really good you don't see a person

on the porch but you can see underneath

the awning is what appears to be a

donkey tethered to a small wooden cart

it's out of the rain and awkwardly

placed and it's just kind of standing

there and but with your roll

you also notice that there are maybe one

or two people around the fringes of the

alley just sort of making their way back

home or just sort of getting to where

they need to go nobody seems to be

staying in one place for very long

except for what looks like a small child

in a cloak standing next to a rain

barrel across from the house that you

are currently watching and it this child

is watching the house as well and it

makes a weird gesture toward the house

okay that's us so and has not noticed

you at all is there darkness I assume

that there's a lot of their back alleys

so yeah this is even though it's

technically the middle of the day the

dark pendulous clouds overhead have all

but blocked out most of the natural

light and so it is quite dark here it's

like seven o'clock at night kind of dark

sure so carefully kind of sizing up for

this this short cloaked individual is

standing and kind of looking at the

surrounding area narai is going to with

a a comfortable practiced motion walk

into a shady spot okay in the street is

this and this individuals within sixty

feet I assume yes okay and is going to

try and aim herself to quietly silently

step out from the shadows behind this

kid okay so to figure and calmly without

without or without like you know they

like hey surprise

just just set my hand on the cloaked

individual shoulder

okay you can you catch the figure by

surprise and when it turns up with a

start and realizes what's behind it but

can't quite make you out in the shadows

that envelop you you can see underneath

its cowl eighty fling vissa jaeyoung

tiefling girl who's got a cleft lip

through which you can kind of see one of

her yellow Fang teeth and she looks at

you with great surprise and doesn't

immediately say anything shouldn't you

be running along home it's wet out I

can't give right now before you go I say

earner I says kind of kind of like

grabbing and like like tensing her grip

just very slightly I'm on the show on on

the tiefling shoulder who's in the house

the waffle crib friends of yours no not

friends of mine and not friends of yours

either sister nor I are we ok so oh ok

are we acquainted I don't know never met

her ok he says I know who you are I know

all about you and here isn't our friends

and who would that make you

and I'm actually if I may yeah I'd be

open to rolling like a persuasion on

that if that's something that you'd be

open to what are you attempting to

persuade her you're trying to just get

on sir it's more of it's more of an

entreating like I'm like trying to say

hey hey hey it's all it's all we're all

friends here

or clearly not but that's you know

whatever okay make a roll all right so I

rolled it 12 and then I plus six so it's

going to be a great wait she says if

you're siding with them you're making a

mistake

cuz they're all gonna die soon and what

would you know about that nor I says

kind of narrowing her narrowing her gaze

at this this kid says I know everything

I set it up but it doesn't change

anything it's gonna happen no matter

what you do to me what are you gonna do

kill me I'm just a kid I was gonna say

it's like it's water deep guys so I

wouldn't risk your life to save them all

right um so while maintaining my grip on

the individual shoulder Nora is going to

quietly cast charm person interesting

okay what is it throw it's going to be

looks like looks like 18 okay

da da da okay so you cast the spell on

her and almost instantly you can feel

her posture and demeanor change to

suggest that your spell may have taken

hold or is in the process of taking hold

although she hasn't acted yet however I

would like you to make a charisma check

as you realize you think she may be

charmed by someone or something else oh

that changes things

alright oh I do I need to use my camera

for this I rolled it I rolled the 20 no

you're good your spell seems to override

the existing charm on her and she says

I'm sorry sometimes I can be cruel life

at your age and for a child in a city

like this can often be cold and painful

especially when you're stuck out in the

rain like so many are the beholder made

me do it you shouldn't be consorting

with beholders I was just like you when

I was your age I say kind of kind of

like almost like not quite kneeling down

but kind of making making making my

frame a little bit less like you know

but height differential that's a little

less obvious okay I said and I said what

what is this beholder have you doing

running assaults on mansions and things

like that you should be learning

mind is right for it you're right this

is all wrong we have to warn them we do

and what's your name may I ask dear

tilith tulip Oh a pity that you've

gotten swept up in all this uh I'll tell

you what why don't you and I do we have

a moment before before the before the

the cavalry arrives it won't be long now

they won't see it coming

well I'll tell you what why don't we go

up to this house and why don't we go in

where it's going to be safe and and we

can explain what's going on when we're

in there but I want you out of the rain

first and foremost and if you've been

standing here for as long as I've been

standing here you can smell the food

from inside and I bet you would like

something warm wouldn't you does smell

good idea why don't you come with me and

and just and just kind of keeping like

it's keeping a comfortable hand on kind

of the like the the back of her neck

small of a back area I'm going to kind

of assure her gently across the street

and we're going to walk across yeah if

he goes and if there is rule on the

porch yeah I am going to gently tap on

the on the door of the of the mansion

hello donkey she says if you tap on door

and the rest of you hear a knock on the

door it is the same knock you heard

before we're cool strikes you cast your

spell giant spectral chickens appear

throughout the taproom like a bunch of

tiny ones obvious least tell me they're

big ones all walks down with his with

his good cape on he's like alright I'm

ready

yes EF you see he's wearing the Cape he

wore when you saw him in the street

and it seems to almost have a life of

its own billowing dramatically is it

just the caper do you also get like

Steven Tyler hair okay the Steven Tyler

hair is all his you know mm-hmm are you

like he like does hey he looks at you

he's like it's pretty say great you're

standing out on the porch nor I with

tulip and this donkey and nobody is

answering another knock are you still

dressed like strikes yes okay what's the

traditional greeting like you know to

her tree does she say like

married roll tide I don't know yeah yeah

happy troll tide she's like oh right no

no no no I'll get it I'll get it

I got this I like crack the door open a

little bit when you do out on the

darkened stoop you see two figures one

you recognize is the tiefling child you

saw her in the wharf right you didn't

like her then you certainly don't like

her now and next to her is and Brooks

will you describe your character sure so

as far as you can tell a human a human

not particularly a human woman not

particularly tall probably about you

know five six five seven kind of short

hair and kind of am in a military cut

that you've seen before but it appears

as though it appears very well-groomed

she's wearing just sort of simple black

and gray garments they look to be a very

high quality but she doesn't look to be

she looks to be kind of dressed like a

like a courier or like you've seen

Nobles often have kind of agents that go

around doing their bidding for them and

she's kind of dressed similarly that a

lot of you know I'm sure that you see a

lot of water Davian kind of couriers

notably she is not marked with any

houses particular livery

she just looks as though she

and that's kind of the only thing that

stands out and she looks like a courier

for nobody and obviously she's been out

in the rain so and she's soaked yeah

paulten looks at her and looks at a

little tea fling I'm just kind of back

and back it's like there's no

resemblance I don't think that's your

kid but if you're gonna say we kidnap

that one we did not don't worry about it

it's fine

became kind of like tries to flutter out

the door

Narayan going to kind of look him up and

down and look at him kind of try and

fight his own cape and and say and say

my name is narai I'm a security and

accommodation specialist and and this

child and I are looking for somewhere

warm to sit and have conversation with

you hey we just lost our roof so it's

pretty drafty in here I noticed that is

that secure no jury's out well and then

leaning into the crack in the door

she'll say well it should be please let

me in

now ask if she's with his entire room

are you in

of course I went the centaurum she she

says of course better in which this is

the first time she's startled she's like

[Laughter]

yes there's this tap room with a badly

sort of charred and blackened bar looks

like a fire happened there and but

there's that beautiful new wooden spiral

staircase going up through the middle of

it and some other sort of old furniture

and a bunch of spectral chickens

hovering in the air among this panoply

of characters that you see before you

and releasing her grip from the small

short sword hanger at our side she's

just going to take the room in for a

moment and say to no one in particular I

hate

tied game immediately closes the door

behind her and starts like locking it up

and making sure everything else is

secure so it's clear you've heard yeah I

got the message message what message do

you want to share with the class the

message yeah d/f

have you it's been like a minute Jesus

scary Oh contraire yeah d3 they points

at hers like what the hell is she doing

here

now please no I says kind of kind of

kind of trying again in treating and

offering a comforting hand to the to the

kid before she can kind of back away as

kids do she says too obsessed field yes

touch me and I'll stab you in the eye

this she's so sweet this child has

become wrapped up in in with an

unfortunate group of crooks and she may

have she may if you treat her right she

may be able to help us with the

situation that we have on our hands

gifted hallo sir do you suffer to tulip

kind of narrowing his eyes and looking

for any kind of displacement in the air

or down tear perhaps if something

invisible is floating with her nearby

make a perception check good it's gonna

be real good that can't be bad at

anymore 21 you do not see a little

baseball sized beholder around or even

suggested presence of one alright she

might be clean she's not wearing a wire

how can we be sure dear three lays to

the other said he got the sending

message about how zanaffar coming in as

santarem was sending their best agent

but on troll Todd they're ruining troll

tied I he cares so much about all these

you hear about a holiday for one day and

it's like your thing like way

I'm pretty sure Lysander is the god of

holidays am i Rob he's the god of

everything beautiful and wonderful oh

you all here down under the hatch in the

floor the children start screaming oh

heck that's why I come down there and

tulip turns to you Narayan says that

coming up from below thanks many oh how

many do you know oh jeez

okay do you have your armor on

underneath is remember she got that

shield as a gift and she like barely

paid attention to it cuz other things

were going on it's still sitting at the

bar so she like snags that on her way

down it's in the box so you have to kind

of get that she shakes it out real quick

packing peanuts go everywhere

okay so yes you get your shield out I

know she still doesn't really know what

it does but we use it great

so you whip open even before you can

reach for the hatch it flies open and

the kids come barreling out all

screaming with Simon behind them do you

think I've had my weapons on me probably

not I'm gonna roll for I don't suspect

you were going to go to the door to

greet a bunch of children with weapons

[Laughter]

there's like an empty bottle oh dang

that's badass

even grounded the shield and then she's

looking around for a weapon and she sees

a bottle and she's like alright and she

grabs it and smashes it on the face no

Ryan's going to mother who thought

zanaffar was going to send assassins in

through the front door and said how

secure is this basement where are they

coming in from that's a good question

because there are no

it's like assassins excuse me everybody

roll initiative alright and so we're all

too busy arguing and making each other I

roll the thing and it does this do that

20 so 2606 football tonight dear uh Chad

evylyn 15 Strix 14 no I 23 I really hate

being the new guy in like rolling at all

well paltin look we can you can as the

kids come pouring up Simon who's the

last one up kicks the hatch shut behind

him I'm smart nice and when they hatch

disintegrates okay just palton you see

you see a flash of green light engulf it

and then it just sort of turns to dust

and falls away and you immediately

recognize that as a disintegration ray

is not gonna last a month palms like

season is just like Perkins we're past

this you don't have to do that the door

just opens puts the kids behind her and

tries to take like point against the

door it's not my turn that's the flavor

yeah okay cool the kids are helping you

evil in by actually sort of running

behind you you got a big shield so that

helps I'm gonna I want to turn to the

kids and be like how many are there

so squidly will give you some bogus

number Jencks will give you some other

number nath will sign you a number and

probably if he even notices that you're

talking

then between those numbers you can

probably conclude that they saw maybe

three three yeah okay just like there

are three hugs just like there was I

don't know whether ten okay cool so I'm

gonna go ahead and can I like can I like

walk up and like peek in to see what I

see

yeah you can it's dark down there there

were some lights that the kids some

candles that the kids had and those

candles are sort of sputtered out at

this point but as you gaze down in the

darkness you can see the lumbering

floating shapes of at least to be

holders ah why there's also a back a

very foul stench that wasn't present

before to suggest that these are

probably animated zombie be holders like

the ones you fought down in the sewers

zombie holders zombie holders that's

true

excuse you I will we will get there I

will try and be competent yes or

designed by a five-year-old okay so I'm

going by the way you also can hear what

sounds like gruff humanoid voices down

there but you can't see from your angle

where they are where they're coming from

so the B holders are not alone okay so

I'm going to I would like to cast

mislead okay and I'm going to have I'm

going to have illusion me like just like

dead sprint down there to like try in a

distract them and be I want to use their

eyes and ears to like get a better feel

of everything that's going on yes so the

rest of you see from from your point of

view palton runs down the

there's the rest of you see hinges we

don't documents as a spell oh right I

should have conveyed that clearly before

he goes down it's like it's fine

all right then in that case he makes a

little somatic component a little

gesture and then he runs down the stairs

the rest of you take that to me and he's

cast the mislead spell which means he

turned himself invisible created an

illusion of himself in the exact same

spot he was standing in and that

illusion is what's run downstairs cool

nice yeah all right

and so down it goes and you can see

through its eyes and ears palton but

again you're a human and it's dark down

there so you don't saw crap

well then he's just like down there like

just trying to like run circles and just

be really like distracting whoa no don't

don't kill me all right so palton has

run downstairs in a fashion Narai narai

is going to also cast a spell okay

Neriah is going to make use of this

phone darkness which she will cast upon

the hatch or the space where the hatch

once was okay and you want the darkness

mostly to fall down below or do you want

it to engulf word I want mostly fall

down below so when you as soon as

they've reached that level of the hatch

they won't have any idea what's going on

in God idea okay so suddenly it becomes

utterly dark down in the basement and

palton or illusory palton can't see

buckle oh oh it's not a big basement oh

it's not it's not very big but you

wouldn't know that so can you look not

you would not have any insight into that

so it becomes very very dark down there

illusory palton starts running into

walls and things and so do some of the

bad guys because even dark vision does

not pierce your ice spell so you guys

can hear confusion through the inky

blackness that now is just under the

level of the hatch would you like to do

anything else in the RAI you have

movement I do so I am going to

I mean I'm going to I don't have much

that I can do I don't you know I'll take

I'll take to a wall I'll make sure the

tulip is guarded and and try and move

her along with the other kids and then

and then and then I'm going to take a if

I if I can I'm going to yeah just

basically stick to a wall and keep the

hatch in view okay in that case even uh

with the kids behind me in the shield

held up in front of me yep

I want to cast Moonbeam into the whole

okay now if you do that you know it's

probably gonna hit the stairs the stairs

into the basement yeah yes okay I just

finished the spiral staircase I care

about this one this one I was gonna run

ons Moonbeam shines down upon it

basically comes down from the ceiling

and shines down upon the hatch and

falling into the inky darkness below so

basically any creature that comes up out

of the hatch is going to emerge in the

Moonbeam I'm just filling the opening

with damage right and so you see anybody

not not yet okay now the Moonbeam they

take damage when they start to their

turn in there is that correct no when

they enter or start their turn got it

mm-hmm okay

and I think I cast that at third level

okay great so you increase the damage by

a d-10 yeah groovy okay Strix there is

now a moonbeam on top of the darkness on

the hatch and your spectral chickens are

still parading around in circles okay

all right I'm going to cast is that

spectral chicken one concentration yes

okay cool

so so those are my current concentration

if I cast another spells that break the

concentration so

so I was just gonna do mage armor on

myself okay so I think I can cast other

spells I'm pretty sure I don't think you

can have two concentrations no not so

yeah yeah but you can cast other spells

you lose concentration on a spell if you

cast another spell that requires

concentration okay okay these ones

concentrate on two spells at the same

time got it okay so I will do umm Mage

Armor on myself okay and then who is

closest to me probably okay and then I

will click and spell death word on dear

okay yeah if you've got a death word

yeah and if I can I don't know if I can

but like the chickens are in a certain

area so that if if these thing if

anything enters this area of it this 15

foot radius around strikes in the party

then the chickens will attack them right

yes so they might actually be within 15

feet if we're in front of them no have

enough okay all right cool so that's

chickens are ready to attack yes they

are so we've got chickens and we've got

moonbeams and chickens anemia miss

that's the other name for this episode

and then we come to DF there's chaos

downstairs in the darkened basement as

your enemies come to grips of the fact

that their dark vision has been blotted

out but all the children are here and

accounted for

correct as soon as as soon as the

beholder started disintegrate their way

into the basement they ran okay good

I can see that evil is currently bravely

wielding a broken bottle but I wouldn't

know where she keeps her weapons right

probably in her room yeah they're just

like messily strewn on the floor because

she was so excited dressed up that's

right she was like yeah so they be up

yes they be up on the third floor I

could probably get up to that room right

pounds even if I'd cunning action - well

you would be stopped by doors hey it's

still okay tearful turn to the children

and we'll say quickly now up this point

for safety and even kind of signals and

gestures - NAT - stay like they need you

to lead them come on

alright do the kids follow DF squigglies

like I don't know you well you've been

hanging around with him for a few days

now I don't know you well enough new

songs got hit by disintegration beam

come on now I did it you come now

quickly just kind of didn't just like

shuffle rattling marches along okay

one's armored the deaath even says Simon

YouTube come on

and then he'll basically lead them

upstairs far away as possible I guess -

Evelyn's room yeah and just puts them in

there's like you'll be safe in here okay

well you won't get that far but do you

want do you want to live up there - I'll

give a about tulip yeah and - up

for her she while she's turned by you

narai she doesn't that doesn't mean she

has any love for any of them great no

that's fine cuz she will she will use

yep yep so I'm using cutting action too

- up there as quickly as possible while

the children follow and basically by

goal is to get there as quickly as

possible to find one of Evelyn's weapons

retrieve it and bring it back down to

her you get to the common room at the

top of the spiral staircase and you

realize you're one short and that's

because squidly is dragging his heels up

the staircase oh my god slowly come on

oh go and I go oh okay whatever that is

so a I think squigglies name sign is s

with like squid legs so he squiggly and

so that is yelling squiggly come that

doesn't never works a rotting beholder

lumbers up through the hole that it

vaporized in the floor and finds it up

burning in the Moonbeam

so really roll your dommage for that

dommage yeah loudly and it gets a saving

throw which it fails so you'll do again

let's do it oh my gosh

okay 21 21 points so it gets radiant

damage to by that

Oh what I need to know just check that

was on a d-10 it was a ten to ten in a

one nice a spectral chicken Peck Sabbath

so earlier damage for your here's your

spectral Guardians okay it failed it

save so it takes full damage okay so

just a great it took 39 points of damage

and is still there badly burned and

badly pecked and then it's going to fire

an array at oh let's just determine this

randomly shall we let's see the kids are

gone which is good yes gone tulip is not

a target invisible paltin appears

invisible so their number of targets is

now three

evylyn we are targeted by a ray and

let's see which one a black crackling

Rey requires you to make a constitution

saving through I do

did you order I'll work on yourself I

don't remember yeah versus this is a

magical attack yes it does so um

actually yeah that's gonna be plus six

plus six twenty six okay well you will

definitely save and you take half damage

as the Ray washes over you and your

shield oh this is actually with my

protection actually when a creature you

can see oh never mind just kidding okay

never mind so I take how much you will

to end up taking 22 points in the

qur'anic damage oh okay

and it's the only creature that emerges

this round so you've got this undead

beholder in your tap room and then

paltin you've got your illusory image

down below

running around in blindly in the dark

does it seem like something tried to

hurt me or no because you think all the

creatures down there are blinded as well

you may have run into them accidentally

or they may have run into you but no

attacks because they don't really know

you're there

well that was a good use okay I'm going

to now you know the bedroom well enough

that you could get your illusion out or

the bedroom the basement well enough you

to get your illusion out of there if you

wanted to I mean or you can just sort of

have your illusion kind of flail around

blindly and get a sense for how many

antagonists are down here mmm

they said three and he doesn't seem to

be doing much down there so I kind of

wanna ditch him all right what do you

want to do I so now this uh this

beholders just like God chilling this

the stanky dead beholder most of its

eyestalks rotted away staring at you

with a cataract

infested I so when after I got hit by

the the Moonbeam and the the chicken

it's just yeah yeah I guess it could

have continued this movement out of the

Moonbeam and that would have been the

smart thing to do but it's a zombie so

it doesn't it just stays there and

growls does it look kind of messed up

from the damage or yeah but it's not

it's got more than half at set points

you would suspect okay I'm going to

thunder wave this thing in its whole

face okay okay I just I see this thing

and I'm trigger I'm like no hope all

right I mean it is all face so mm-hm

you become visible it fails it's saving

through so it takes all the damages what

do I say yeah so 68 Christopher these

Ray's spells are they just magical

they're magical they're not spells

24 oh okay that has quote-unquote

bloodied it it's lost more than half its

hit points at this point and you send it

it's ended blubbering mass back and

smash it up against the wall of the tap

room with a sort of splat sound yeah yes

like nope ie

function yes that sort of careens around

and smacks into the wall face-first cool

and then it is back to narai okay so

narai seeing this thing being sent

reeling is going to leap into action

while this thing is kind of on whatever

balance a levitating creature can have

yeah it's also out of them it's also out

of the Moonbeam so you can get to it

pretty easily and then I will do that

there then she will do that thing go and

and make a series of arm strikes against

this individual all right so first to

crack your knuckles goes up and punches

this rotting beholder 15 to 16 okay so

that's gonna be a 24 and a 23 to hit to

it's okay and then I will also I will

also do my flurry so I will get two more

hits so I'll do sona ride just starts

punching and kicking the crap out of

this thing

 man I'm nervous because I'm getting

all my good rolls out of the way now

alright so that's gonna basically it's

gonna be a six another six another 16

plus a two 19 plus eight so 20 it's

gonna get more hits okay

all hiss okay bring on the damages all

right so

okay so just reach it fire that's 1216

is 28 damage okay as I Buffett this

thing yes and is that thing is that

total a total of 28 it's a total of yeah

yeah cuz it's one yeah one D six plus

four so yes I rolled a two a three a two

and a five got it okay and then I will

extremely hurt as you start punching it

it's just getting bounced around and

large chunks of flesh go flying off and

you probably rip off one of its eye

stocks and throw it in the ground if

there's still time and still movement

movements left yeah I would like to oh I

can't actually him right okay so I'm

right there that's all that's that is

what it is very good and so then it is

evil ins turning this thing that's very

very hurt

you got your concentrating on the mean

yeah and I can make melee attacks but

not another spell and maintain my

concentration you can maintain your

concentration if you can attack and

maintain your concentration on the spell

you can also move that you can also use

your turn to move the Moonbeam there's

still we think there are still some down

there though right yes I'm gonna leave

it okay um do I I have no further

insight as to what this shield is other

than just a piece of metal that protects

me right correct

okay then I'm gonna try to stab the

boulder with a broken bottle okay you

leap up and stick it famous last words

this is improvised a try and so the

modifier would be my so it's made a

disadvantage but is there any modifier

tutors in a-flat d20 uh it's your you

add your strength because it's a melee

attack that's right okay so it's either

oh okay it's the 13 you you try to cut

it and you're not able to get through

it's thick hide I try

again okay my second attack very good

still a disadvantage I assume yeah

that's not gonna it

okay you start waving this broken bottle

in front of its face it stares at it in

horror with its remaining eyes

evylyn is very disappointed she does not

like being caught without her gear yeah

Strix you're ruining trouble time and

you okay I hate this

I still have concentration on my

chickens question deaf ward

does it work against disintegration

Wayne it does yeah okay so it keeps you

from getting disintegrate that's correct

okay cool and I'm going to twin spell

death Ord on myself and evil and alright

all of you all three of you have death

wards ah paulten is the only one lacking

at the moment cool well you're invisible

no I'm not

you can't spell my ways I'm also dressed

like Strix so when she twin spells on us

it was like okay

and she just yells at Paul to fake I can

only do at a time just get on the ground

oh that's fine last time I got the

centigrade it went really well it was

really funny so yeah it was cool DF you

were able to get up to evil and swim and

see her weapons and armor scattered

about the floor good I take her favorite

one

hey Spinelli you can see that the kids

have sort of knowingly formed a chain

kind of out the hall down stairs okay

they all coming into the room or no they

were they were assuming that you were

going to like pass stuff to one and they

would toss it to the next and they you

know just sort of toss it all down to

evil him can we do that from like down

the stairs squidly has no trouble

throwing down stairs this is also

two-handed grates

this is like a big great story yeah yes

I don't know I don't I'm not gonna do

this now yeah

yeah yeah if it's just gonna like hold

the door open like a signal for them to

all like quickly get in okay they'll

pour in the evil ones room and just be

like and they close doors like stay safe

listen for this knock and don't break

Yulin stuff the same door okay and then

idea is holding on to the hardest

Spinelli which is actually even

difficult for him to cunning action -

we'll start making my way back towards

evil and so I can toss it over that

first time you probably ever picked up

this one it's like yeah you just you

just like I don't understand

guess physics doesn't work for paladins

okay she's really strong okay you make

your way back and then it is another

beholder comes up out of the hole evylyn

you burn it with your Moonbeam Strix you

peck at it with your spectral chickens I

lost my d-10 where'd it go that's a 13

this time for radiant damage from

spectral chickens chickens I was about

to say that's 13 from me okay and how

did you how did you do that Strix 13 13

thank you

all right so it takes damage from both

of those effects and then let's see

random target Oh paltin guess what what

no no okay question question what is

what's what's going for me

the second beholder that's just come up

through the hole in the floor turns a

ice talk to you and they Ray fires out

of it would you say that said beholder

could be charmed you're not sure

you think it's Undead

undead cannot be charmed can they okay

go for it all right

actually you're the one has to go for it

I need you to make a dexterity saving

bro

okay this is very CSD inducing for

evilest ache that is an eight what color

was the Ray maybe that's a happiness

don't forget about the hora hora hora o

plus five

uh no plus 6 so 8 plus 6 wait I lied

working it was 5 I lied I just not

excited okay 13

you need a 14 cool yeah wait but maybe

there's something else Oh when a

creature you can see attacks of target

other than you within 5 feet used a

reaction to impose disadvantage is a

qualified mob arm for the disadvantage

paltin is not within 5 feet oh it's not

a check rolls it's a spell so saving it

is not an attack actually it is not a

spell either cool so it's just a

you that's yes rather richer setting

yeah alright palton you take 42 points

of force damage of what force ok image

mom takes this so you just like do you

have any hip points left

yes that's odd alright some of your

clothes just sort of vanish off your

body cool as your as your molecules are

disrupted not nice fun the second

beholder which is miraculously still

alive and pushed up against the wall

fighting to rai and evylyn will turn its

array on evylyn alright evil and I need

you I'll have to figure out which I Rea

this is way he just disintegrates some

of my clothes

playing even a mitt make a constitution

saving throw evylyn ruining troll tied

taking everyone's clothes off

eight okay okay this is a saving throw

so actually I get five so magic number

is 14 so evylyn you find yourself

suddenly paralyzed and unable to move at

all not an eyelid not a lip not a finger

nothing you are don't you go completely

rigid and I couldn't have no it's not a

spell you know damn it it's not okay and

then it is Paul Tain's turn you

recollect your molecules what's left of

them there's one very badly hurt to be

holder that just paralyzed

evylyn and another not so hurt be older

that just tried to vaporize you mmm okay

cool oh and on this turn you here below

you that the the basement is swarming

with what you assumed to be goblin OIG's

of some kind bugbears it sounds like oh

geez could be over a dozen of them cool

this is really cool good features okay

all right I'm gonna I'm not like engaged

with this just the holder am I am not

like right next no no you're about ten

feet away okay

I'm gonna try it no it's dark down there

 alright cool

well heck it I'm just gonna blast this

thing in its face okay is this another

thunder wave that that would be correct

okay so you have to kind of direct it

away from your friends and it sort of

blasts over it and also sort of

annihilates a section of the bar and the

the glass behind the bar

that's fine renovating renovating it's

okay but just here's this like mr.

absolutely devastating sound and it

fails at saving throw so it's gonna take

all of it okay I was gonna say that I'm

casting at fifth level but I'm out of

fifth level so it looks like I'm no it

looks like I'm gonna cast it six level

oh jeez okay great

I'm just like I'm tired of these things

god dammit oh so that's a lot of pace

that's a lot of things they're not good

rolls oh wait I have one more yeah Oh

25 holy smokes okay

that bloody is this one as it the energy

ripples over it's rotting body blowing

pieces away and sending it tumbling back

forth over the bar past the wreckage and

kind of into the kitchen doorway mm-hmm

and as my bonus action which thanks to D

and D beyond I know this is a bonus

action did I see that I see uh evil and

get frozen yes okay I would like to uh

Kaspar 'test Bartok inspiration honor

okay play a little song and add a sweet

détente or whatever it is yeah it needs

to do on our saving throw

she may be paralyzed but a little tear

Wells up of happiness Alton like just

gives a little like a little like gleam

link just King all right

next up is narai okay there are two be

holders very close to you now one

extremely bad off the other one about

five feet away nuts about off okay so I

oh okay

oh okay so they're bomb they're like

both adjacent to me okay there you can

easily move from one to the other

okay so in that case this is actually

something I don't know about monks can I

split flurry of blows and sure again

great yeah super that will do that so I

will do - yeah two strikes on on the

real bad one okay and then scoot over

you don't have to decide - right away

yeah one attack on the seat so make your

first time alright so first check first

attack I rolled an 18 I hate this no

that's fine all right

and then 11 good cool so that's gonna be

a say a 20 26 and 19 it okay those are

both hits okay 14 damage we're first

goes right into its central it's blind

central eye and you sort of fish around

in there and you rip the eye right out

of its socket

flick it down on the floor and the

creatures baby yeah falls over Dada Dada

it falls over dead you leap over its

carcass to the other one great

two more let's do it I Terry Tate pain

train is coming

yep this one's been blown upside down so

it's kind of hanging with its eye stalks

down toward the floor after being

blasted backward by the thunder wave I'm

going to do two two more on arm strikes

for another flurry of blows and I rolled

my die off the table so one of them is

going to hit one of those gonna be a 24

the other one is going to be

a a13 that bounces off cool bunny will

do five damage all right so you dropkick

this one and do some light damage to it

but it's still alive

okay and the rest of you see there I

just punching the crap out of these

things

and then holy it is Evelyn's turn

evylyn you get a saving throw at the end

of your turn and you can add the bonus

from paltin to it if you wish um you

don't you don't have to decide to add

Bartok inspiration until you're old and

this is plus con call right I get 20 you

break the hold

spell at the end of your turn and then

Strix what do you do I just I really

don't want to cause any more damage to

our home Lord you got a demo in order to

run out no stop arch and the to be

holders are up here but I still want to

be holder up here the other ones been

be a six okay well your damage okay

well while I'm pummeling and witnessing

all of the roll narae's pummeling and

witnessing all these fireballs and

moonbeams going down into the basement

your eye is going to ask are there any

load-bearing pillars down there anyway

and I'm going to try and avoid any low

load-bearing pillars oh well you can't

because you can't see them all right

this is an old house so you cast it down

into the darkness there's this roof

sound and then a massive explosion as

fire sort of comes up through the

floorboards around you and there's this

big orange glow underneath underneath or

a green glow underneath you so

everything in the tap room suddenly

turns this weird eerie cast of green as

the explosion go off goes off and you

can hear flesh being torn asunder and

burnt to a crisp

and you smell fur charred fur just

billowing out of this hole and you hear

the death screams of you don't know how

many bug bears but a shit-ton and then

you come to that you come running down

the stairs with planetary there's just

like a little bit of like yeah you hop

down and you can see evil in there what

do you do yes he's coming down hill -

out evil way and like toss the hardest

'smelliot order I'm glad she's not

paralyzed always that would have been

really funny okay so this big-ass great

sword comes spinning at you evil and I

inspiration oh yes you do cuz I rolled a

seven so okay we're gonna roll the

little so there's one beholder up in the

tap room with you it's sort of upside

down and Neriah is punching the crap out

of it alright yeah so for adieus then

comes back around with moon splinter and

frozen that the beholder okay yeah

session okay now it is within range of

an ally Oh would you allow sneak attack

means moon Splinter goes through

magically through its body and comes

back through its body and into your hand

yeah

damn son it's just like this trail of

just this trail of mist as its

teleported back to your hand and then

the bee holders eyes all closed and it

just sort of flops down on to the floor

and the good tulip looks at you on the

stairwell and says so you don't want me

to call him off then and that's where
