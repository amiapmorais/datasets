DICE camera action a D&D show the best

D&D show we are down are our fourth

prettiest regular member Nate Nate is is

busy with other things during all that

business why not but but we have Scott

kurz joining us thank you my my amp well

thanks for asking me man that played

been win again I've been looking forward

to this for a long time so to catch

people up a quick recap previously in

dice camera action the characters had

been settling into their manner which

they've dubbed the Waffle House in the

heart of Waterdeep and have had a few mm

incidents that have forced renovations

or destroyed renovations as the case may

be but the place has endured a fair

amount of hardship lately most recently

during the festival of troll tide the

zenith are the beholder crime lord of

Waterdeep launched a major assault to

avenge the wrongs inflicted upon it by

the waffle crew in the past namely the

murder of several members of the zenith

our guild including prominent mind

flayer that attack was nixed the waffle

crew successfully defended their

homestead driving the enemy back into

the sewers from which they had emerged

the cistern awry a zen tarom agent

assisted in the defense of the waffle

house and was duly concerned not given

the zenith r's nature and the the

brutality of these attacks that perhaps

the waffle house was not the best place

for a group of children whom the waffle

crew had kind of inherited after these

street urchins helped rescue their pet

al bear

who had been kidnapped I want to pet out

there yeah me too you can have one if

you don't want the rest of the show

exactly yes so sister Nura has left she

took the corpse of a street urchin named

tulip away with her

the rain has abated you have slept

through the rest of that night and the

three or three of you are up and about

the following day there is as you recall

in what used to be the tap room there is

a gaping hole now open to the carved out

earthen basement below and it's full of

dead bodies and burnt corpses and a

beholder pinata on the end of the

ten-foot pole through which the zanaffar

was speaking magically all of that is

still lying in the wreckage in the main

room of your house well be at least

start picking up those bodies cuz that's

just a natural reaction for her so you

just see her take her staff with the

like the point and just use the point to

just kind of like roll them out the door

she's like you're just pushing these

corpses out into the street yeah she's

like don't worry the collectors will get

him when it gets dark it's fine I feel

like Diaz has explained to her many

times that water deep is a very clean

City relatively speaking and they will

do a lot of cleanup but rest assured if

you start just dropping corpses out on

your front lawn the city watch is likely

to investigate before anybody should

have to clean them like like your mom

does the Easter Bunny or something like

like the collections will think of an

even weight so she's got and then picks

them up for her

so as she puts as she pushes them out

it's like it's like a fireman's like

like train like evil em takes it back

inside through the back right she's like

wow so many good there's a lot of

collectors and water to you they must

get good for this body is not

convenient if you are looking to dispose

of all these charred corpses without

catching too much attention you have a

basically disintegrated tunnel all the

way down to the sewers under the city

you could drag them down there and

essentially just let them flow way okay

so yeah alright so as Strix is trying to

like put out the first body like I'm

sure one of the party members who isn't

broken will tell her that there is you

don't want to pile bodies up outside if

there's an HOA we've already angered the

neighborhood enough yeah better that

contaminate the whole water table of the

city what pushing them like putting the

dead in the sewer

I'm leaving for bad guys right we Kayla

mind flayer and several undead be

holders in the sewers I'm pretty sure

there's far worse things being put into

the water a couple of dead bodies it's

not the water quality she's dead yeah

yep you can pray over them while I shove

them in the water okay

these aren't these are bug bears and

moldy old Undead beholder corpses and

things like that so your holy purpose

morning Lord and may they be boarded a

new dawn of less evil being whoosh

alright sits by the entrance on a stool

with a cup of black coffee just okay so

after cleaning out the basement of all

the crap and you've also got some broken

shelves and other things that were

destroyed when strikes those fireballs

went off and whatnot you get rid of all

your garbage

clean out you realize you've still got

this tunnel leading down to the sewers

that's open I don't know if you plan to

keep it open for the time being or what

I may revisit this ok fair enough

and then over the next day or two it

dawns on you that obviously that the

taproom cannot have this big giant

gaping hole with the basement exposed so

you might want to maybe tap some

craftsmen from the the Carpenters

roofers and plasterers guild and have

use my sending stone to contact Magnus

okay and just be like hey we're think

about having some things done do you

know a guy around here that you can

trust discreetly from the background

here there's a hole it's been so Magnus

can easily tell you that within water

deep the guilds basically control

everything if you're a professional

you're probably a member of the

corresponding guild to which your

profess in his profession is attached

and they have standards that they all

have to basically meet he can definitely

give you the name of a carpenter or a

series of carpenters who are members of

the carpenters roofers and plasterers

guild and they can come by great I'll do

that can now ask for a one who does jobs

no questions asked okay

and so you you hook that up and you are

visited by a group of guild members one

of whom is a dwarf named Delvin gray

hill and he seems to be like the money

man basically sets up the contracts and

gets things underway and he did come

recommend it but honey when when Delvin

realizes it's UDF his manner changes and

he becomes

well let's put it this way he doesn't

really commit to dates and suddenly

starts to give you this rigmarole about

having other projects on the slate and

it might be a few weeks or months before

they can actually assign anybody to do

the work and you get the feeling that

the the price he's quoting you is

probably high is this because he's a

dwarf is he mad that's racist you don't

need to hire anyone I'm way into DIY

right now I've been what do you call

Pinterest boards and fantasy fantasy

Pinterest and then after sort of meeting

with him and after he leaves over the

next day or two it becomes quickly aware

it becomes aware to you that delve ins

influence in the guild is such that you

you do have a kind of a hard time

navigating at that point getting getting

a commitment from anybody damn it

an able enroll for DIY and try to do it

herself

why wait evil and you should go talk to

them everyone loves you okay I love you

too I mean I do love you I love you my

friend please help us fix the hole in

the floor okay like it's just like

suddenly regret saying that you've also

got a the turret that's missing its roof

that's not as big of a concern it's a

nice view of the stars at night they the

water damage that was caused by the

rainstorm is extensive all right

you go ask them to fix this stuff you

you even just polished up that sha

modifier

she goes and addresses the guilt is

there like a building yeah there is a

guild headquarters that you can go to

she walks in yep the last things of the

morning low urge upon you I'm Brandon

I'm here on a matter of some importance

as my house has water damage okay and

what is it that you want from them well

see we'd have to lobby all over the

house

and it seems like there's some problem

with getting some repairs done and I

just was curious if there's anything I

can do to kind of just convince you to

maybe be you know fair and your frosting

and you know do your jobs okay you can

go ahead and make a persuasion check

sweet a do your jobs persuasion checked

yeah sorry I'm I'm at a not my computer

so things are a little bit slow today oh

my gosh uh yes I thought so plus 9/2

persuasion for even okay twenty-four ooh

that's really good okay they are struck

by you in all the ways that you would

expect them to be and they tell you that

they will push off other projects and

get on this as quickly as possible and

they show you their standard rates sheet

and you look at it and it is marginally

less than what you were quoted so that's

good news too I'm sure Colton will have

no and and given given the size of the

project and the fact that your your

house is a historic location oh yeah

they will further reduce the price and

so the repair work that they're aiming

to do you think is going to cost you in

the neighborhood of total of fifty gold

pieces

I'm sure that our bard will have no

problem paying that off from his recent

tour yep and that's down from almost

just over 200 so good job well thank you

I'm just so pleased and made the morning

Lord shine upon you for your generosity

while evylyn is away DF and Strix there

there is somebody who sort of comes in

to the place

maybe they knocked and it just wasn't

loud enough or maybe they thought

because the door was kind of half

hanging off its hinges they could just

walk in but you see a man middle-aged

tall and dressed in an overcoat and he's

got a letter in his hand and he like

looks for a place to put it down and

there's like nothing all the furniture

has been destroyed and wrecked anywheres

fine just anywhere just yeah he talked

he sort of tucks it into a crack and and

then he leaves did he look official

business

I can't tell it's probably just some

[Music]

yeah it's probably a bill as soon as I

read it that means we have to pay it all

right it's it just folded so you can

kind of unfold it and take a look at it

and as soon as you see the first words

you realize exactly what it is first

words our dear neighbors yes it stops

right there okay fix is like peeking

over his shoulder like this I'm just

trying to read it since your arrival we

as residents and shop owners of troll

scowl alley have observed a market

increase in criminal activity and

unwelcome disturbances having lodged

formal complaints with the city watch

we have since been informed that you are

adventurers and that being so we should

be grateful for the

you have rendered to our city particular

with regard to the matter concerning the

trash monsters be that as it may we are

gravely concerned that your activities

and associations might lead to further

unrest and violence in troll skull alley

the likes of which might be typical fare

for Luskin or Baldur's Gate but not

water deep should the explosions wanton

spell-casting

and screaming persist are you mad my

sleep we are prepared to elevate our

concerns to a sympathetic magistrate

sincerely the neighborhood watch of

troll skull alley and underneath this

letter you can see names and signatures

from various people like about 30

different people it just sort of keeps

unfolding one of the names you recognize

is emic foon he's the owner of a small

pub called Fran's brews that opened

recently another one you recognize is

Rachelle

she's a Dragonborn who owns the

bookworms treasure a small library on

your block oh I have definitely been

there she probably hates me yeah and her

other shop owners whose names you have

passing familiarity with well we'll just

know which shops to frequent in the

future I'm not there you as you digest

this letter Strix and DF a shadow falls

upon you like an emotional one or a

physical a physical shadow of a figure

standing darkening your door and as you

turn you see the silhouette of a portly

dwarf wearing a helm

that's missing one of its horns and

might have you know arrows and bits of

glass stuck in it and but yeah

definitely dwarven stature and just very

rotund yes immediately holding the

pavers like yes we just got the message

we are very sorry we take all your

concerns very seriously we are gonna and

we're trying our best to rectify it

please be patient as he says that Strix

turns into rats behind him bin win as

you walk into this place that kind of

looked like a tavern on the outside you

were a little concerned because it

looked like the windows got smashed out

but that's your kind of tavern so

whatever you poke your head in you see

this kind of civil tongue man holding on

to a very large letter and a witch for

lack of a better term a tiefling dressed

all in black with a pointy hat who

suddenly before your eyes turns into a

mass of rats that fall around this young

man's feet and I came in thinking this

was a tavern kind of yeah when you look

around you see that it definitely has

the aspect of a tavern inside this used

to be a tap room but some Titanic blasts

or something has blown up the floor

destroyed the bar leveled most of the

furniture caused a hole in the ceiling

blackened to the rafters and pretty much

destroyed anything bottle sized that

used to be here Incy Wincy will

explosion maybe like four of large

explosion yeah there Lee's done multiple

explosions in the top and the bottom and

the basement I've been one says yeah

that's good to know I don't know what

you're talking about

what I do know is I've got a massive

hangover I heard this was a Waffle House

and I'm looking for some hay and some

smothered hash browns to nurse this

hangover so you could just point me to a

the counter I'd love to get some a

little hair of the dog that bit me Strix

is like

our first customer when Sheila turns

back into strikes like next to him but

like it's kind of half rats and she's

just like do you want a pie dad yeah

I'll take a pie I can put eggs in it

Thanks let's do it by a friend of mine

that's known as a quiche oh she's like

never heard this word she's like oh yeah

I imagine as this HAP like she you see

her run outside and you hear like I

forgot from like a neighbor's place I

can you see her like a run back in with

like four eggs just like all I have eggs

and then like goes into the kitchen you

just start hearing like explosions and

flower fly out and now you guys are

alone she's all right I guess we are a

restaurant now ideas just kind of sees

how excited she is to actually do this

and make a piper a quote a customer and

he's not gonna want to ruin that so look

I've been waiting sky it's like yeah go

ahead and take a seat at the you see

there's like a bit of floor around the

edge of the room it's all sort of jagged

and charred and then just gaping pit so

there's literally no place well actually

when you look past the blackened

fireplace you can see that there are

alcoves that have sort of intact

furniture still in them so if you kind

of skirt along the wall you can actually

get to one of these alcoves and find a

place to quote-unquote plant your button

okay I scoot past the thing look over at

Jared I'm like remodeling strong survive

the straw chair did survive yes there's

this big Gothic chair in one corner of

the room just kind of sitting by itself

oh I definitely sit in that okay while

you're sitting down you can hear

upstairs or you can hear the floorboards

above your head groan and creak and you

hear what sounds like a monster bouncing

around directly over your head but like

playfully bouncing yeah like al bear

running around kind of thing

you also hear screaming children and

you're like is that good screaming or

bad screaming and just make a make an

insight or a perception check Scott I

can do that Wow all right here we go ooh

18 plus 5 great you you here it's the

playful kind of screaming like maybe

there's a monster up there with kids but

the kids don't seem to mind you probably

couldn't click clearly shows that you

here's this idiot is just like oh that's

that's don't worry that's just our pet

all a bear and a couple of children we

are currently fostering for their safety

d/f looks around for a bit they are very

safe yes yes yes Wow her name is waffles

appropriate oh yes here in our exploded

house upstairs of our elver these

children are so safe alright catch us in

between some remodeling but we have

people on the way which is very exciting

so come back sometime when things are

nicer as they say got a demo toretto

said that strike strike will run in with

their pie yep probably done at this

point and she just like brings it to you

and it actually like should I roll to

see if it's good or is it getting

advanced like she's pretty good um yeah

I don't think you have to roll to see if

your pie is edible the is long and you

do have all the ingredients and stuff so

yeah but it's gonna take you like maybe

2025 minutes to actually cook it in your

brick oven and that kind of thing so in

the interim bin win is just sort of

sitting in this big giant chair next

parked next to this table and just kind

of looking around yeah yeah this sort of

sitting I kind of look around I said

this is a very odd Waffle House I have

is this a franchise I have never seen

one like this

Oh

now it's not franchise at all we don't

really we're just we mostly live here

and it's kind of a new venture sorry

my name is D F and this is Strix we just

lit live here for the most part yeah

cool

I've been one but she knew that right

they don't seem to know me that is a

great question so DF make a history

check strips you don't have to because

when he says the name it trips something

up in your noggin that you've seen

you've seen pictures of this dwarf

plastered all over things having to do

with acquisitions Inc his face was on

the side of the battle balloon that you

float that you that's right ran around

in space is on it oh yeah I rolled a 9

on history okay yeah it doesn't doesn't

ring a bell to you DF I still please so

while Ben Wynn is waiting for the pie

and Strix is having her Eureka moment of

recognizing who he is probably while

she's like standing in front of the

brick oven just waiting for the pie to

be done yes she does that's when you

walk in

evylyn and you you see that DF is in the

middle of a casual conversation with

what appears to be it for sitting in

Paul tins chair it was like right I know

of ecstasy and I'm like hello it's

little bit taller but basically dwarf

some mighty big weapons for a gal her

size and wearing flying boots she

doesn't write yes she's really what kind

of weapons she's got a great sword and

she's got a big acts like a glue X a

couple javelins

it's got a it's got a bit of a what are

you like a nose guard kind of thing that

sticks down so it it yeah it's fun well

let's see I killed a Tarasco bout six

blocks over

when he says that suddenly DF and evylyn

you both remember that at one point a

gigantic statue kind of went berserk in

the lower parts of Waterdeep and sort of

stomped through the city and then

proceeded to kaiju a big giant monster

yeah that was you yeah like right in

she's like oh he works for almond or you

did I think that big giant statue

basically destroyed like 20 buildings

and including an orphanage and a tavern

and I mean that wasn't my fault as soon

as a strict says that he used to work

for a whole menu actually CDF's face

just kinda like immediately tensed up a

little bit like a real sense of

frustration is just building there he's

having a hard time holding that back

just like here's your pie sir please

enjoy this fine establishment would you

like something to drink well I'm sorry

we don't have anything drink when she

puts the quiche in front of you it

smells really good the whole time yeah

it's weird

okay she stuffs the whole thing in

mm-hmm

[Laughter]

she's so happy this is just like else

you need or will you be going uh I mean

I'd love another pie if you can make one

make them another pie no I've lost my

appetite

what she's like hurt

she shuffles off did you say you used to

work for almond Ron I did used to work

for almond Ron yes what's he like you

know he's he's tough but fair

oh he's tough but fair and he's he's

strong-willed and he's great with

numbers and pays for yeah pays for

everything that's nice and he talks a

lot like a worker knife I like words too

uh he's good with numbers but how is he

with like matters of the heart you know

well you know I've always suspected that

omen is very very very much loves and

matters of the heart but he hides it

very well

behind a you know behind the tuff of an

ear oh I know how that is

I he seemed upset when I killed his

sister I'm sorry I did sense of motion

that it came through Wow why did you do

that she attacked us oh well that'll

happen yeah I don't know how you feel

about this she was the evil sister hmm

yeah oh yeah yeah just that one I'm sure

um one time I skimmed some money off the

top of a kinks profits and spent it on

two things that I won't discuss here

because I don't know if it's safe for

the stranger but he found out about it

he cried then too he cried he did yes

Terry started to ease up a little bit

our hearing peas thing she's like yeah

yeah probably when I was comparing dia

that the the way he describes a binman

was probably somewhat of a thorn in home

inside to himself well why don't you

work for him anymore well we had a

contract disagreement mmm there was an

issue about branding mm-hmm

I got tired of Jim dark magic setting me

on fire oh he did many times don't you

hear from the kitchen magic it's true I

mostly left because I thought for once

you know in my long extended dwarven

life I would like to run my own shop and

so I got my own minions and that goes

not worked out at all at all

but you know what good on you cuz you're

absolutely right you should sit down

you're all gonna do your own thing no

one really ever ever needs to ever

follow all been drawn or listen to

anything he ever says so good on you

Benjamin I know we just met but I'm

proud of you well I appreciate it I

don't know if I'd agree to a hundred

percent I think that I think that I

really appreciate the time I spent with

almond drawn but yeah he's the worst I

know what you mean

I hope he appreciates the time that I

spent with him one time another dwarf

yeah you come in with the pies and just

as you do another dwarf darkens your

doorway

this one appears to be no no appears to

be an old woman female dwarf gray long

braided hair she's wearing old ancient

robes with like a big high collar kind

of containing her head and she comes in

and she sort of looks around at the

devastation and then she she looks

across the big gaping home the floor at

you strix while you're juggling your

pies and she says I'm sorry a stone

marrow

we're closed that smells good whatever

it is

oh I made one for Dias even though he

didn't want it we can make another one

strict show me how come on in come on in

we hands more room will stay open rakia

[Laughter]

I try to find her I find her the remains

of chair Rick did it now there's nothing

left of cherry okay but there are other

chairs around she will talk she'll pull

out from one of our pockets of feather

cast a spell and then the feather sort

of goes poof and she just sort of flies

over the hole in the floor and land

safely on the other side equal flutters

her wing boots areas like I see you she

says I am a member of the watchful order

of main gist s-- and protectors I

understand that you have disappears into

the kitchen we have a what I understand

you've had some problems and I can see

that there have been some incidents here

perhaps the magical defenses on your

place are not up to snuff

if we had any magical defenses she gives

you her card which is a little stone

sheet with her name carved into it and a

glyph a sigil on the back and she says

you only need to break this and I will

know that you want me but if you do need

my services I cast glyphs of warding and

other spy defensive abjuration magics

upon buildings for their protection that

is amazing what kind of things can you

ward off anything entire factions

perhaps well you could name for instance

a particular kind of creature that you

want to be to trigger a glyph and then

the Glacial magic will take effect is

all of them in option potentially if you

have enough money

didn't win steers from do you have a

glyph for to make oil salesman because

we have no man not on the bar Scott

she sort of casts a baleful glare at you

evil in O but doesn't say never accent

well Strix has already handed off the

pies to everyone and she sees her

looking balefully at evil and and though

she has magic she's like me thinking

it's pie and she hands them she brings

the pie over two deities like this is

for you even though you didn't want one

and then she walks over to the mage lady

and she's just like I am the resident

magic person she looks you up and down

and says well of course you are why

don't you show me around maybe I can

give you a recommendation for a

recommendation for for what for

defensive magics of the abjured have

come I can't do that kind of magic well

that's why I'm here dear strikes show

her around show her like the things in

the basement maybe give her some

multi-eyed recommendations perhaps right

right all right come on she hears she

hears the ruckus above by the way and

she says this doesn't seem like a safe

place for children

ah look every family is different and we

we have our child-rearing methods and

you have yours and that's fine

I'll show her around and Strix will be

like it's very safe I've taught the owl

bear to eat everyone that's not them all

families are different I want to make a

book now called Johnny a school bear all

right maybe these children who maybe

have parents have just decided to stick

around and you know maybe they're in

mortal danger all the time but true yes

and she as Strix leads her away she sort

of stops for a moment

back and says to evylyn I'm sorry dearie

what was your name again

Oh me I'm even a balloon and whole thing

Mart they pleased to meet you in the

service of the morning Lord hmm and she

turns back and says Astrix - maybe we

could start with the kitchen she says

all right but I'm gonna warn you I use

green fire in the in the oven and I hope

that's not against cold it's code no

there's nothing like that don't worry

about it and she says you can do no

wrong can I inside check this lady she's

like yeah like do no wrong that's

definitely something I've never been

told before

that's 18 you think that she's she's

being kind you don't know exactly what

she means but you get the impression

that she's not misleading you and she

says we are Kings spellcasters always do

what we intend even when we don't

remember that miss tricks is like no I

mean I I definitely don't intend like

the hole on the floor was not intended

just to point that out the floor needed

rework anyway right it was falling apart

she's just soaked if she's like wait no

no but I did wasn't blown up on that no

man you have to be responsible she says

of well yes that's true but this is all

part of your plan

what and she stands in the doorway and

she says oh that's curious

and she looks at the doorframe and you

see for the first time carved into the

door for

a tiny little glyph up high she spots it

and you notice that it's like oh that's

interesting

she says oh do you have unseen servants

trapped in here I don't know they were

trapped if you scrape away that glyph

they won't be oh do you think they're

unhappy here who cares oh I don't want

to be unhappy I want to stay here if

they want to be magical effects dear

they don't care neither should you

well I'm gonna ask them they won't

respond and they'd sort of disappear

into the kitchen together and have a

wizard conversation

the kids come trundling you hear them

confronting down the outside steps run

around the side of the building and then

come crawling in through the windows and

suddenly Ben when you are in the company

of three others a small tiefling boy

with an eye patch and a bow little bow a

young girl thin black long hair with a

wooden sword taller than the other two

and a boy in wizard robes with a crooked

wand and a stuffed Alberta under his arm

they come stomping around and then as

soon as they kind of the as soon as the

they see you they're like they just sort

of stopped dead in their tracks your

eyes get white yeah it's just like we're

also part boarding house I guess I don't

know if anyone likes kids or not I've

never thought about that that's what Ben

says out loud while he's done while he's

stuffing the second pie in his mouth

come over here

yeah squiggly the the tickling boy

probably gives you the finger and runs

away but what do NAT and Jencks do just

like wow you look like a big adventurer

the I he's maybe he's heard stories of

Ben win or something I feel like jinx

yeah gentlemen see see this board has

weapons on him and things like that

seems to fit Wow what's the biggest

thing you've killed my own insecurities

and of tarrasque oh I like that

insecurities not not so much that's

that's a little bit this is my familiar

he like shakes the owl bear at him Papa

I'm working the relationship between

parents and child

uh-huh reduce the DMV so what am I gonna

do yes you're welcome

well regardless of how been one feels

Jenks loves Jenks is thrilled to me

Bedouin small child is just like wow

yeah it's just like I'm an adventurer

too but she says that in sign language

so I don't know if you notice or

recognize it I'm sorry you threw me off

what happened you like children

one of the kids one of the kids has

glommed onto you and the the young that

be the the wizard the young girl with

the sword is signing you there anything

like old people I don't like them no I

like it I definitely like the attention

so I love these kids especially the one

that flipped me off okay so she's

signing me we see him can we do an

insight to see if maybe been when his

learned sign language he is a folk hero

mystery well inside is plus 114 you're

able to pick up a lot of levels

she says words here words there she's

just proudly sim signaling that she's an

adventurer as well like you guys are on

equal footing okay well I make a point

to go

oh you're an adventurer well you look at

her shitty wooden sword always a little

it's a little crappy sword yeah it's a

little wooden sword yeah I look to make

sure like as it and make sure no one's

looking and I pass her a dagger she's

like thank you yeah you can see there's

even like a little bit of blood and

crusted in the where the hilt meets the

blade but Charlie sharp knife is a safe

knife

okay okay baby be careful with that

don't show the others Jakes it's like

hawk up with the lady who smells bad

never gave me a magic thing hey what's

in that like maybe you should be a

better adventurer huh

yeah if quickly explains to Ben when but

these children's are key witnesses in an

upcoming trial of a pretty important

figure here in water deep and we're

trying to keep them safe and until then

well no problem

now I'll help you keep them safe really

yes

I love these kids I've decided Ben one

loves kids I'm gonna train that one to

be a minion me yeah if they die they'll

die working for me oh we're trying to

keep them alive

well I'll keep them alive until they're

trained for sure at least but for now

we'll keep him alive all right fine you

know it's it makes sense trust me

Oh Corbin logic it makes it makes sense

if you're not sober which is a real

problem right now are you sure you don't

have anything to drink looking around

there's blasted remains of flagons and

Chardon shattered bottles everywhere but

nothing nothing our stores were

exploded explode exploded there exploded

key holders dug through the basement

through a tunnel and just destroyed Wow

yeah those are a problem yeah speaking

of strikes how's that glyph coming uh

does she hear that in the kitchen yeah

right now Oh Cory is just sort of

looking around you're taking her kind of

around your building establishment out

the back door of the kitchen door and

then sort of around the outside of the

building and she's pointing to windows

and doors and all kinds of other things

where you can have glyphs put on to

basically ward the structure and they

can be anything from glyphs that deal

damage to glyphs that cast fear spells

and other effects that basically just

drive enemies away from you but then she

tells you that the price that she

charges per glyph is 300 gold strikes is

like maybe which is standard but she

will reduce her price to 250 each

because she knew the previous owner of

this building and has a tremendous

amount of respect for her oh and she

asked who owned this building before I

did oh why did you leave because I got

busy and had other things to do and I

have other property home-owning is a big

responsibility

strictures like impressed she's like wow

so these are your unseen servants yes Oh

is there anything weird hidden in this

house that we haven't found yet no

probably what I mean is is it weird is

it on a ley line like what why is this

place weird and also why what just it's

scary I created it myself so it's me in

a way that's concerning could possibly

maybe do you except work maybe I could

do some work for you to help you pay for

these glyphs like maybe you do you like

pies I can bake you some pies I can tell

you all about all the

we've seen we met Asmodeus isn't that

fun you know who he is

so gold reach cliff that's a pretty good

deal theory and if I can certainly cast

custom spells on these glyphs to trigger

to ward off particular threats if you

know what they are as for paying off the

money well what can you do I can set

things on fire

mm-hmm I can I can turn things into into

chickens I can turn myself into rats I

can make my friends happy what if I were

to since you're obviously a good Baker

what if I were to invest in a bakery

would you be interested in running one

she just like has like Fanny so she's

like I yeah I mean that would be an

excellent business nice place has never

been one before been a lot of things but

not a bakery I think we have magic

bakery yes I see there is marketing

potential there make maybe a bakery plus

a place with magic yes potentially I

like this like strikes just like purpose

which is like why would you do that why

would you be nice like we you aren't

like why are you nice to be I don't

deserve this this is I've no one needs

to be well I'm just a trash person

deeply we were certainly not be good to

that's the first rule of wizardry and

baking mixes still dislike why is this

person being so nice

I can you can even sense that

negotiation is going on any other room

wandering around the outside of the

building and having a conversation that

raises and tenor loud enough that you

can hear it at times alright so I'm

gonna say that I heard something to be

effective like 200 even just point her

poked her head outside and be like for

your charms to have any effect on me

young one Oh like evil and she used to

own this house she's hurt are there any

secrets about it she won't tell me I

think she wants us to find them out

because it'll be funnier when we hurt

ourselves or others but until you get up

and started I suggest that you take

those kids somewhere safe though I think

we have a Claudia's house a plan I don't

have a plan for them I don't know but Oh

rather strange

she says looking over your shoulder what

what you can see there are other people

out on trail skull alley because you

know it's the middle of the day and it's

not pouring rain out it's it's a nice

late spring day and you can see that

people are sort of giving a wide berth

to a what looks like a moldy old coffin

that is being that is floating toward

your establishment held aloft by what

appeared to be six big spherical

balloons and you realize actually no

they're sort of these weird beholder

like spore fungi these gasp spores some

of which you encountered in the sewers

and they've got nets thrown over them

and hooked to this coffin so they're

basically just sort of floating it in

your direction every day yeah that's

we need to we need to be we need glyphs

against beholders that's dead be holders

in particular the rest of you kind of

look out through the broken windows of

this establishment and you see this

mouldy old coffin and it's just

incredibly mold and mildew being floated

toward your mansion oh you guys got rid

of dungeoneering as a skill didn't you

yeah well yeah but you you as a dwarf

would have stone cunning and other

certain skills oh well okay yeah I guess

that's not been generic doesn't well you

know about different monsters I just

knew that you would use nature for for a

lot of monsters unless they were weird

and outer planar monsters then Arcana

would probably be used instead okay uh I

want to make a check to see if I know

what the heck this thing is yeah go

ahead and make a nature check that would

be a three I can know what this is yeah

at first it looked like that this thing

was being carted by B holders which

you've seen pictures of these big

floating they these these orbs that are

tethered to it these balloons do look

passingly like B holders the round their

spherical about four feet in diameter

they have these spore growths coming up

the top of them that kind of look like

ice talks at first blush and they have

this sort of fake eye central eye that

kind of glares out emptily on on their

fronts but it's clear that these are

really just sort of fungal creatures

bearing the weight of this floating

coffin is just a bomb this is a bomb the

way it's drifting toward you suggest

that somebody must have gotten it up

here somehow and sort of pushed it off

in this direction and it's just kind of

lazily drifting your way and it's just

kind of kind of half turning back and

forth so look into the house be like

okay there's a bad thing come to us

probably mom looks like it's beholder II

we have to stop it and you can see

remember some other people in the street

are gazing at it curiously

they've never seen the like but right

now at least keeping a semi distance hi

[Laughter]

excuse me

yep Alton so you come downstairs after a

long night it's like it's like late in

the afternoon it is late in the

afternoon at this point as a matter of

fact okay and when you come down in the

taproom you see that there is somebody

else sitting in strods chair

halten like walks in which drink in hand

you just go I've been when you see this

kind of disheveled human young man with

like black hair sticking up weirdly

mm-hmm it looks just as disheveled as I

do right now

so I say I'll pay you for that drink

it's like no one's got that kind of

money but I like what shows the rest of

the party in here yeah except except for

Strix but you hear her outside the panic

the usual panic but D it's in here yeah

yeah yeah she like turns to DF and like

points out the chair is just like TLDR

did what Roswell X a kink Bob or

something is coming to the house we got

to stop it it is Tuesday so is evil in

this room with me yes the door so she's

like there but was yelling its tricks in

the lady okay I don't know what that is

but I don't like it's coming for us and

we need to get out of here best thing

stays in the streets there's a good

chance that people everyone outside

could also be hurt

get everyone down below through the

tunnels to the sewers we can use that to

escape well come back for it like

herding everybody

so you're hurting the children down into

the source okay strong breeze I think

it's just floating we just pushed it

just someone else you stick your head

out the window you can see that in fact

in front of the house floating lazily

toward it is a mouldy old wooden coffin

being held up by six gasps spores these

big sort of spherical balloon like

fungus understand the net is draped over

the spores and attack yeah each each

spore has a net draped over it to sort

of keep it from floating off into the

air and it's been secured to the coffin

so and looks like the coffin is floating

maybe three four feet off the ground and

these beholder like spores are about six

feet off the ground all right if I get

I'm gonna turn my staff into my broom

here like I have an idea idea and I'm

gonna go take the Nets off yes I was

just thinking the same thing harmlessly

float to the sky yeah so strictest will

turn our staff into a broom and also

like look at mage lady and be like yeah

that was cool I'm all right you can see

some of the some of your neighbors who

are kind of watching as soon as your

broom goes off in a sort of backfires

and this big cloud of smoke erupts from

its back end a lot of the neighbors sort

of look and you can just see the

expressions on their face like oh no not

again

strikes is used to that expression so

really that's the expression that she

always gets eyed she's up in the air now

is that what you do yes she's going

towards the to take the Nets off of the

spores what are the rest of you doing

Ben one runs out and if I can reach it

I'll try to cut the ropes holding the

nets to the coffin with my ax that you

can do anybody else well death toll the

evil one to take the children to the

sewer so she was like hurting everybody

and then she realized no one was behind

her so she's like guys that's not the

plan anymore come on I'm chilling since

she grabs them all and she's leading the

chart of charge of the children she's

letting them come with her because she

doesn't think this is a big threat all

right so evylyn will pile out front with

the children behind her they uh mmm is

still just kind of like your chair has

been warmed now by the way sorry about

that

he like sits down he's just like oh it's

warm

yeah it's oddly warm there too and more

pie plates next on the table next to the

chair few crumbs but that's it also some

crumbs on the chair he like just kind of

great it is uncomfortably warm I have

many questions on the temperature of

this individual all right so strix bin

win Ben when you're gonna go up with

your ax tricks how are you planning to

cut the ropes I have scissors in my

robes okay so you sort of fly up next to

them and the you start chopping away at

the scissors all right the two of you

are successful Ben when you slice

through those ropes no problem

whatsoever strix on the other side of

the coffin you cut the ropes away and as

soon as you do exactly what you expect

happens happens the gas pores begin to

fly up like untethered balloons slowly

maybe gaining about a foot a second so

after about 10 seconds they're about ten

feet higher than they were but they are

kind of drifting up and out of this wide

alley the the coffin just sort of

crashes down three feet onto the

cobblestone street and it sort of cracks

and bulges its sides pop out a little

bit like it was really really rotten

search looks at you looks like evylyn

can you do it like some Lysander stuff

to that I don't coffins are you justice

maybe like let's say turn undead didn't

it certainly okay she does not detect

any fiends Celestials or Undead in the

coffin any strong evil either doesn't

she get that from that is true as well

actually I should qualify this she does

not she doesn't not detect any of those

things or evil coming from a coffin

however she does detect the presence of

an evil fiend within her field where you

start to kind of look around at all the

faces of your neighbors are staring at

you and of all Coria stone marrow the

dwarf who claims to be the previous

owner of your house you I'm just seeing

how much you can pinpoint this you know

the location of okay so as you scan

around your divine sense goes past all

Coria past some other towns folk that

you've encountered frequently in this

neighborhood and focuses on a man who's

talking to a young woman on the corner

of a building they're both looking in

your general direction because the scene

is obviously odd but he is just sort of

talking to her while watching you at the

same time and as soon as

you beeped in on him he knows or senses

that you are using this paladin ability

to to identify him you said you will

fiend

right yes even just toward him

evylyn goes darting off in a random

directions I guess I have to look in the

coffin well that's cool meanwhile a

paltin still like trying to dig like a

couple last crumbs out of the crevices

god damn guest characters coming it

can't have nice things

indeed yes we'll go and join Strix at

examining the coffin okay and Benham is

there how he was doing

yeah the coffin looks like it's been

nailed shut the lid is all like the rest

of the coffin Rottie and it wouldn't

take much to rip the lid off yeah

alright back before you get your staff

on anything you start to sort of pry it

open like a crowbar bin wind just sort

of grabs onto one end of it haha tenaris

the whole lid off and it just sort of

splinters apart as he rips it off and

what you see inside is possibly the most

disgusting thing you have ever seen in

your life

there is there's so much sort of mold

that's encrusted this old coffin it

looks like somebody dug it up years ago

and just sort of let it rot in the

sewers for a long period of time

probably was very warm and damp so there

is this sort of mouldy flesh that sort

of clings to the inside of it and kind

of creates this soft almost velvety

interior in which you can see the the

the head and crossbow of Nazca the dwarf

in what you can see his the crossbow

that used to be affixed to the end of

his arm is just sort of lying in this

mucky mold next to his decapitated head

Paulding leans out the window he's just

like

what's in the box what's in the bar

there is also sticking out of or rather

between the severed head and the

crossbow there is a shattered piece of

stone that looks like it may have been a

creatures torso before it was petrified

it's like a broken piece of a human

being or somebody basically the the

breast of this figure and there is a

symbol in in the stone like maybe this

creature was wearing some sort of

talisman or amulet or something that got

turned to stone along with it and it is

the symbol of Lysander next to it is a

petrified hand possibly from the same

person human hand looks like a old man's

hand and there is a scroll tube not

petrified in it yes tricks tricks the

story to get a little worried about the

founder stuff and start then like make

sure that even lives like kind of gotta

tag the theme and seize Dias covering

his mouth right now because it's really

like oh whoa I don't know what you're

doing takes the scroll and reads it

Bolton sees all this like all these

reactions I'm just like all right I'll

just go out there then I'll just walk

over okay so I see I see

nós whose head yes you appear down into

this rotted coffin and can see no SCA's

head and as you gaze upon it it starts

to bulge and boil and you can see that

it pops open in two or three places and

these spores

start to shoot out of the holes in his

face hey just close the coffin has been

shattered so it's been torn completely

so I'd like everybody's roll initiative

cool like right before that happened

know when Paulding seas ahead he just

like for the record this was not me you

too Chris do we take a long Reston's

last time that we did cool tricks for

this initiative it was 21

oh sorry 21 yeah 21 yes sir rule 20

freaking 914 palton first rolled back

and that would be a NAT 105 5 and bin

win 23 23 and the fiend alright so all

of you around the coffin saw even go

charging toward a man standing on a

corner who looks like maybe maybe he's

one of your neighbors or maybe he's just

coming through you haven't really seen

him before he looks well dressed got

dark hair swept back from his forehead

mustache and a VanDyke beard and a nice

overcoat with his ruffled shirt

billowing out from underneath and he

looked surprised

as evylyn careens toward him but before

that happens bin when you see these

fungal spores erupt from the severed

dwarf head glaring up at you and as they

sort of rise up out of the coffin these

spores just sort of go and kind of

inflate into these baseball-sized gas

spores Oh fun okay so our date they're

like floating up at me yeah they're like

these baseball sized spores floating up

at each of you and there are five of

them they don't look like they're I mean

they look very

small and non-threatening in a way but

mmm spores I hate to bring this up but

if the children followed each one

outside are they there probably since

she took off after the fiend they are

there nearby the the coffin and the

others but no longer near evylyn okay

just checking

but Vinland yeah it's your initiative

what I do here if I swing at these

spores and you know face ball fungus or

so I'm gonna face full of poison and

although I have a resistance the poison

there's no need to risk everyone I was

trying to think avoid that I had a

weight if there was a way to contain

them

can I try to use dois mm-hm wondering if

I have a small sack in my in my well I

have the phrasing wonder if I have a

small bag yeah you could probably you

probably have a sack yeah you could

probably take it and use it to try to

scoop up one or more of them I won't try

to do that all right I'm gonna have you

make an attack roll with an improvised

weapon fortunately these things are

really easy to hit okay so all you have

to do is roll a d20 and add your in this

case yeah I'll let you use your strength

bonus just add your strength bonus to

the d20 roll wow that's great that'd be

a total of six because I rolled it - Wow

okay so your improvised bagging skills

not so great but these things have an

arm class of five so congratulations

oh that's good enough that is good

enough and just roll for me if you will

a d4 or the d4 simulator - I'm sweeter

than immediately okay good and so you

you know you've got those two in the bag

there are three more drifting up out of

the coffin good okay and that's your

action you can still move if you want to

mmm I'll stay close just in case I came

back some more yeah you can still you

can use the same bag to try to scoop

some more on your next turn if there are

any left

yeah then Strix I'm feeling real panicky

about this poor Toria shouts those are

gas spores if you break them they'll

explode cool uh what should I do

don't break them can you gently blow

them away with wind you don't do that I

can I cannot you know what I'll just use

your hat oh my hat all right

that's a good idea I'll take my hat and

just try and like blow them up oh all

right so you can do that to one of them

and just sort of blow it up into the air

okay and so that's your action and so

now that there there are two sort of

hovering over the the coffin now that

Strix is kind of sent one up into the

air and bin ones bag to the other two

what does Jenks do Holly I mean he would

he would cast a spell mm-hmm he would

possibly cast I don't know

wind something wind gust of wind yeah

got some wind yes so this little wizard

boy waves his magic wand in camps some

gust of wind spell points the wand at

one of the creatures and then just

starts going with no effect yeah but in

your mind

Jenks you can see that this creature is

just fighting against the torrent of air

that you are blasting out in this

direction

it is only by virtue of some great

beholder magic that it is not repelled

now there I'll support you evil and next

up is the fiend who sees evil and

closing in on him and he's just like ah

as you race toward him he looks

surprised by the aggression and he will

cast a spell

evylyn and I need you to make a wisdom

saving through my liver would I be able

to counter spell this potentially

alright I guess paltin could as well if

you felt like it could I yeah

potentially you so wished I rolled a six

so someone better counterspell I feel

like Paulson might be more apt to see

that than strict suit without probably

that's service tricks is probably if I

can I'll I'll counter spell it okay it's

not going to be I don't think it's an

automatic one because it's too high

level spell what if a counter spell is

that fifth level if the counter spell is

that fifth level then yes if it's

allowed yeah if you want to use your

fifth level slots you can totally do

that and you counter spell his magic so

even before he can do anything it's sort

of poof that's it

no no spell for you oh I got called out

I'm not using my aura yes that should

have been +5 sorry

alright well that's still what fail

mmhmm yeah suck it chat yeah so he will

know with your help we stock he will

stret he will stand his ground and kind

of protectively

kind of move the young woman next to him

aside so that she's not caught in any

weird blast area by whatever it is you

plan to do next

and he says he shouts out after the

spell is dis counter spell there are

laws in this city and that brings us to

evil in and she brings the horsemen le

down to bare on beam okay and I'm using

digital device to give me second so

let's do eight yep hmm that's a dirty 20

that's it

sweet and the damage and now that I have

improved divine smite when I get an

automatic extra da to all my demon sick

nice yeah evil ins a banned from these

days

fifteen all right

you deal fifteen points of damage to him

he is still standing he seems to have a

lot more substance to him than just the

skinny rail of a man he appears to be

okay so this time she swings again with

the hardest finale with me intention of

using divine smite oh but she rolls a

gnat one for total nine that one's

always a miss okay

yeah so you you whacked him good once

though the other thing you notice is

that he doesn't seem to be showing any

visible sign of the wound although he's

clearly laboring under the wound that

suggests to you that his true form is

being masked by some sort of spell or

magic I see through your facade feigned

yep and you can see blood fall on the

cobbles so you do know that you wounded

him and net what doesn't that do

brandishes her sword and goes to sit

next to dia okay and waits for

instruction very good then we drop to

death

she's holding action until death tell

specific there's just net wear a cape or

anything Senora she's got a basically a

cape draped over her shoulders yet

perfect she normally has a cone over one

shoulder because it looks cooler but

she's an adventurer

yeah yeah so this ooh she gets next to

dfts just looks down at her and then

like quickly reaches a hand over to very

definitely unclasped the Cape and like

just okay and use that and like grab

grab like both ends with his hands yeah

to make it like a bag and try to like

Halep inland fin winds lean like scoop

up some more of these spores all right

go ahead like acts like that was her

plan all lovely yeah

[Laughter]

yeah and yeah and as you sort of pull it

up over her head her hair sort of flops

into her face just blows it off and you

can make a improvised weapon attack so

it's adding your strength bonus or I'll

let you add your dexterity bonus to this

d20 role okay okay you are successful

now we roll a d4 to see how many you

scoop up there are only two left so come

on baby

four you bag the remaining two of them

inside this cloak and kind of very

deftly sort of tie it off so that

they're in a satchel okay so now I've

got two big ones got two yep and Strix

is setting the other one up into the air

with its big brother's with her hat

right okay so now we just got to get rid

of these how do you rid of a Spore he's

asking two didn't win I have an idea

okay with that palton what do you do

looks like the spore threat has been

dealt with at least for now

mm-hmm but I see evylyn like trying to

laying into a man standing by street

corner yeah uh if I were to walk over

and try and do a persuasion check would

that count as my action that would kind

of depend on what you're trying to do

but yeah if you were trying to chain

basically trying to change his demeanor

or a course of action on his part that

would be in action okay well I'm gonna

I'm gonna walk over to him and like that

like kind of like backing up evil and as

she's like late into this guy or

whatever right and I'm just like this

fearsome presence coming up behind her

it's like buddy you don't want none of

this that would be a big mistake on your

part so maybe you should just take it

easy and why don't we just talk okay

no I'd like to persuade him

go ahead okay so that would be a 28

isn't your A+ to persuasion like 13 or

something now hundra's he he says I

would love to talk let's talk it's like

good man tell him what hold-hold the

horse is there what does squidly do god

damn so

squid leaves nearby yeah there's a so DF

has got two of these baseball sized gas

pours in a bin wins got two in a sack

and and Strix is flapping at one with

her hat he saw the spores right he saw

these spores come up out of the dwarfs

head and turn into these baseball sized

doors so squidly sees the one that is

not contained that's being blown up and

he's like don't worry guys I got this

he's gonna try and shoot an arrow it's

okay make a d20 roll ad nothing too low

Robo roll Oh Evan okay yeah you hit it

and it explodes all right Strix we need

to get rid of these kids I need you to

make a constitution a saving throw and

you're not nearly sorry

he's like do I kid yeah it was beautiful

squiggly you've never seen anything so

amazing in your in your life you treat

you cause this creature literally to

explode at the end of your arrow Wow

a dirty 20 okay so as explodes in your

face and Spore gas washes over you you

do have the wherewithal to sort of turn

away hold your breath all the things

face yeah exactly and you suffer no

immediate effect immediate effect

immediate effect and the cloud because

it was high enough and you got it up

high enough doesn't quite reach anybody

else it comes very very close to two

Jenks and Ben win squigglies all is like

already prepping his next arrow and like

all right guys wonder do I feel like

this might cause problems later mm-hmm

we can nature check

no one's gonna yellow squiggly not

that's another dirty 20 okay you think

that there could be that these spores

may carry some kind of disease element

that you may have prevented to some but

with your saving throw but maybe not

great okay well my anxiety raises like

10 levels and I just look at squiggly

and I'm just like yeah it looks over at

him with his like cape of spores just

Gridley know like okay Ben when we're

back to you hmm I hope you ting them

with arrows do I think this thing is

immune to its own spores um with the

your earlier role you'd say yes all

right well then just got to do it the

old-fashioned way

double axe to the face with my hand axes

come at whom the fiend um very good all

right so are you just are you still

carrying around the bag of this true

spores just a curiosity oh if I let them

go they'll float away right prop the bag

is your bag is probably heavy enough and

they're small enough that they're not

likely to float away in the bag all

right

five two bag and let it drop okay yeah

it just sort of sinks down to the ground

and sort of like a balloon that hasn't

got enough helium to rise just sort of

Bob's there on the grass stones and then

I run towards the Fein say like Tina she

introduced you to my friends rook and

ruin whoo-hoo oh let's talk all right go

at it okay

are these magical weapons per chance you

know

so this is this is a funny here's a fun

dinner this is the first time I rolled

up in win myself um always been prepared

for me by Mike fail our who is super

super super into rolling we have

characters right and loved showing up

the day before our live shows and going

here's what I did for Ben one this time

he's got this and don't forget to do

this and okay and I always used to be

like why can't I roll myself well you're

a big boy when you've been in venturing

for some time it stands to reason that

these are magic weapons yes so they have

our names these are battle axes or ones

about one's a hand axe is that right I

what's embarrassing all those I did it

now I wish Mike was here to rule no

don't worry about it if you're willing

to weapons one of them is probably a

battle axe the other ones probably a

hand axe so yes roll to hit with both of

them and then we'll see what happens

next so the first one is 17 plus are

summe 7 plus 8 so that's 15 okay that

one misses right the second attack is

there we go 17 plus 8 I'm sure that it's

bad hits so with the hand axe it does a

d6 plus your strength mod G 6 plus

strengths does anything if you have any

other wackadoo abilities of damage okay

this isn't talking but I have extra tax

oh I get a third you sure do and you can

make that with the big weapon the battle

axe ranks evylyn is slightly jealous

when she sees them takes three attacks I

was gonna say did you hear that Anna I

didn't even look

time that's why you rolled the natural

one actually is because they have to

sort of tilt it over your eyes again he

says this is not talking that part we're

kind of talking communication what's the

damage on a battle-axe

what are we eight when using it with one

hand 15 Wow okay then yeah so he's more

blood falls on the cobbles but when you

hit him Ben when you can see sort of a

shimmer around him like the human that

you're attacking is really just an

illusion covering something else and

well as far as you know this guy was

just standing he was a spectator

standing on a street corner and evil and

just Rando attacked him oh right clearly

yes you even get coffee right yeah so

this is all justified in your mind

you're just following exactly evil ins

path so after that also just gotten him

to like just talk so there's that this

is the same dwarfed by the way that was

sitting in your chair mere minutes ago

it's like rays I convinced him to not

fight and just talk I see this guy who's

saying oh my chair attack I'm just like

like all right so when was the last like

he's just like looking stuff up he's

like what's the last time we had a guest

character died I feel like it's been a

you do you you do you Strix what do you

do after and after almost inhaling these

spores well now I think I'm dying so I

just like hovering my face up and I'm

just like well now I'm under quarantine

because I'm definitely going to either

give this to everyone or pass away so

it says if you go to a local temple they

can cast the lesser restoration spell on

you you should be fine

why are you so reasonable because I have

I'm old and I have no time for

unreasonableness but that's what I am

you're gonna not want to be here then

okay you're fine so get up all right

it's just like sparrows offering face

like no wizard ever died from a gasps

poor but there's always time all right

what we're just saying anything's

possible anything else tricks she's fine

she has this whole I feel like that

whole conversation with her would have

been her entire turn because she's she

worried about being sick but she says no

I would like to read that

what are they fighting like there's this

demon but he stopped fighting like I

don't know what's happening over there

like what should we do what did he do

it's a way of getting rid of these oh

the spores yes I'll get on my I don't

think I ever changed my broom back did I

no no okay so I have my broom yeah I'm

gonna be like give me the bags I'll take

him up okay let him go be careful

I'm already infected just ain't careful

all right so you scoop up all the

remaining spores yeah and you just like

rock it into the air yeah and then what

do you do once I get way up there like

far enough to where I can see the harbor

yeah um I will daintily undo them and

just sort of empty them out I'm done all

right they are free and they go drifting

up into the air slowly ever so sad

someone else's problem and a little wind

will catch them and kind of blow them

away from your neighborhood what would

Jegs what would Jenks like to do at this

point in time Paulie

well jinx jinx is gonna if he spots a

wizard lady and had a scene strix

talking to her and have it seen her be

so

smart hell walk and be up to her and

just kind of like a gasp like oh hello

little wizard oh you know I've always

heard that is a powerful wand you wield

it is may I test it out I sure he hands

it to her all right

she holds it up and she points it up at

the air and fireworks just blasts out of

the tip of it and she says you just have

to shake it really hard oh and more

fireworks go off and then she hands it

back to you and it still sort of smoking

at the tip this is no wholesome going to

be powerful possibly even the black

staff one day I can tell really truly

shanks is like oh gosh like he just

doesn't even know what to say no one's

ever been so kind to him because Strix

just looks at Evan the Rose pies at him

yeah you know once you start to master

more spells

we will draft you into the watchful

order a major sin protectors and you can

help us defend the city against all

threats including moldy coffins and

guess what I need to prove I can do

magic first and he'll like fling the

Rwanda I'm trying right nothing well in

your imagination you create like your

name in the air yeah but nobody else you

all right well does she say anything to

him like good job yes amazing Bravo I'm

gonna be the black staff one day I can't

wait to tell smelly lady Matt don't make

her really happy all right and while

that business is going on this guy who's

being accosted is going to try to cast

Oh God

Paul Tain's here like he like sees that

he might Cassie you just like go ahead

[Laughter]

and he does he'd know that it was

paulten that counter spelled it yes okay

so he says please we all have to learn

to live together I just work over there

he points to one of the buildings near

where you live

did you just try to look behind me did

you just try to put I'm not looking and

then he just sort of stands and goes

damn you and he does not attack he just

sort of stands there kind of towering to

defend himself and the woman who was

standing next to him the young woman is

aghast and just sort of runs off

screaming keep better company don't come

back and that's it for him he's not

gonna take any other actions other than

asking pleading with you not to keep not

to let the dwarf hack him to pieces and

then it is Evelyn's turn if this person

is an evil fiend does even have any

inclination to listen to them begging

for their life um ah well evylyn you

haven't had a tremendous amount

experience with fiends except of course

I didn't send where you witness the

blood war unfolding before you and

hundreds of demons and devils were

tearing each other apart in front of

your eyes

um as one does but you would know enough

from your religious teachings that there

all kinds of fiends they're Devils

they're demons they they behave

differently but they're universally evil

there is no good fiend in your book nor

would you ever expect to meet one so

unless your divine sense is betraying

you which is highly unlikely this is an

evil creature

of an extra planar nature and probably

undeserving of my job to send them into

the light of a new dawn that they may

reevaluate their evil nature and be born

again and with that sermon I bring my

flaming sword to bear for the record I

did want to talk alright go ahead and

make your attacks that's it that's gonna

be how many for these six plus let's do

a little bit vines mighty action which I

think means we got three extra d8 oh no

not the divine smite oh I wrote so many

ones though only nineteen okay and then

she swings again he is bloodied now and

this time she rolls oh ten that's a mess

ah she just keeps getting too excited on

her second attack where she's like so

the helmet just sort of spins around so

like one of the horns is pointing

forward Matt do you want to do anything

not continuous and Exodia awaiting

orders

she's holding action unless da feltre

when you look down into the coffin you

see it's kind of putrid and disgusting

and there's a severed head in there and

a crossbow that actually you would

recognize as belonging you would

recognize the head is belonging to that

dwarf who hung around for a little bit

she takes she sees this in her face kind

of looks like you know like a child

would reacting to this but she also then

tries to pretend like I'm an adventurer

this doesn't shock me and she stands

there okay and D F D if after Strix

flies off with the spores

that's all spores accounted for aside

for the ones that been when ran off with

who actually restricts grabbed those off

the ground so all the spores that burst

of the dwarfs head are now gone okay d/f

will gently picked those up and wait for

her to return looks over at net and

tells her - yeah and says through I

assume she can read lips to some degree

and single hand language just say gather

squidly gather jinx we need you to

defend the house don't let anyone in

it's not us counting on you okay and

then when she scurries off to do that

districts take the letter from the

coffin or was that still there

good question Holly you took the scroll

out of the petrified hand I don't know

she had a chance okay then we'll say no

it's still there yeah it's still there

she was going to she was like yeah oh

and then was like no okay EF is going to

take that then because he's real scared

okay yeah you it slides right out of the

petrified hand and waits for Strix to

return so you can hand off the next case

you can see that the tube is open on one

end and there is just an old scroll sort

of stuffed inside it okay yep all right

and then it is pole tunes turn palton

evelyn has just brought the flaming

sword down upon this creature at this

man again who's trying to defend himself

holding his hands up in front of him as

she's hacking him down what do you do

like so he'd so the evil fiend shows up

instead of wandering away do we know do

we know why he showed up no well I'm one

of your neighbors geez just say okay

well as he's being like hacked away it's

just like alright I'm guessing you only

have a few seconds to talk so you should

probably just come out with it I run a

detective agency it's called the Tigers

Eye it's right over there do I believe

him make an inside check

okay that is not great yeah I probably I

probably buy that that's a seven oh yeah

yeah sounds legit mmm it's like okay

well not that there's anything I can do

at this point but you know for what it's

worth I'm sure it's a fantastic business

squiggly what do you do buy the coffin

then mat and DF and looking at the gross

crap in the coffin it looks like so

there's the dwarfs head there's the

dwarfs crossbow which was torn off his

arm then there's a petrified hand and a

petrified piece of fragment of

somebody's chest squidly seized a

crossbow and just get like starry-eyed

he's like Oh upgrade you wants to try

and take it alright so you reach in and

you just kind of grab it and sort of

stuck in the sucking mold that sort of

infests the inside sort of lodged hard

inside this rotted old coffin so make a

d20 roll to try to rip it out okay no 15

you succeed for this thing out you shake

some of the mold and crap off it and now

it's a weird device it's got straps

attached to it because it looks like

well as you remember it used to be

attached to the stump of the dwarfs arm

that was good so I'm guessing it's

probably also like way too big for him

so he's just kind of like wobbling

around with it and there's no there's

not loaded or anything it's just the

crossbow that used to be attached to

Oscars are yeah that's what the straps

on it are for cool he's just like right

now I was carrying a sling in and around

yeah he's just like well mine now

alright and you know he has it great bin

winner

what do you

I'm very confused indeed welcome this

half this party wants me to kill this

guy that my girlfriend hates my new

girlfriend named the other half the

party doesn't want me to kill them and

then there's a fungus man still but I

feel right

no no fungus men okay just this guy's

anything should I continue killing this

guy palms like no evylyn yeah okay first

role battle axe

bones just like cool that's in that

twenty oh my okay so double that roll

the dice twice the damage dice yeah roll

the damage nice twice right before he

swings palton like squats down to the

guy he's just like for what it's worth I

was rooting for you Ivan to so I just

like Pat's him on the head he says if

you murder all your no not gonna last

long sorry I apologize the 8 so 2 & 4 7

6 6 plus 4 okay and you added your

strength bonus wait so oh no no no yeah

yeah it was 2 & a 4 X 6 plus 4 Stan okay

thank you I can I can do that and your

second attack yes that's a natural one

alright okay third tech eights are with

me uh the total for that one is 16 hit

okay and that is another 10 points

alright

you chopped his head off and as his body

his head separates from its shoulders

there's this weird effect that happens

the head flies off and it no longer

looks human

it looks like a tiger's head cool and it

sort of flops down on the ground and by

the time it hits the ground the body

slumps and

you see that they spell that made it

look human is gone and it's tend it

looks like a robed man's body except

it's got tire claws that bend back

backward the wrong way like the hands

are screwed on backwards and this is

like this won't come back to haunt us

the severed head says look the tiger his

severed head looks up at you Ben this

will not be like Paul walk so he's just

like what for him right won't be

forgotten for you I just want to clarify

just you know and that's it and then it

expires and then almost immediately the

head and the body begin to transform

into black occur that's never gonna come

out strictures on our way to just like

scoop the cylinder the city watch

arrives in force and a Griffin writing

member of the guard lands in a clear

part of troll skull alley

what do you each do as the city watch

moves in and I'll start with I don't

know I agree with this guy in the chat

no body no crime

well you had a lot of a lot of witnesses

but it's not what's tricks alright so

the guards start to show up yeah I will

just go and run and I'm gonna cast a new

spell that I learned I am going to cast

word of recall okay and everyone is

going to end up

so when you cast the spell just um you

went up to five willing creatures Sophia

within 5 feet of you so you can either

be near DF NAT and squiggly and Jencks

or basically death and the kids or you

can be with paltin bin win and evil and

what do you think definitely dia from

the kids cuz I know that evylyn is going

to be able to explain our way out of

whatever is happening and that's clearly

a demon death are you willing to be

transported back in by away by this

spell I think just by nature of it yes

cuz he doesn't know what's going on okay

he's trusting she's trusting Strix just

casting India's like wait what

alright are any of the children

unwilling to be magically transported

[Laughter]

they love to be magically turns magic

squiggly book you squiggly you

see me see where you see your friends

sort of magically begin to Sparkle away

I guess if they do it then he'll be like

oh okay

alright then you go as well all the kids

in deaath are gone leaving the coffin

unattended

what does DF do after he is transported

back into the house

I assume Strix your safe room yeah it's

the room with that the kids usually it's

actually Strix is panic room yes what do

you do when you're in this room there's

a there's a window and a balcony off

this room and a door leading out into

the hall and it's got all the Strix is

crap and the kids cots in it and strikes

actually when they get there just yells

that worked yes it did

oh good we're all safe okay

evylyn what do you do when the guard

moves in I'm so glad you're here but

don't worry I've neutralized the threat

there was an evil fiend disguised as one

of our neighbors and a local business

owner but I have protected all the

people here and now you see this black

liquor that is filled everywhere I'm

very much pologize about that paltin I

completely back what she just said
