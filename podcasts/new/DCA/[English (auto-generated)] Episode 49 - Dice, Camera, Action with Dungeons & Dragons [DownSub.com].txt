[Applause]

[Music]

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action

yeah yay I already burned out the guest

is everything's fine I'm just coming to

terms I don't want to make I don't want

to just razzle dazzle everyone so the

film is when I'm dead all right

so to catch people up on where we are in

the game

a group of drow delivered an iron flask

to Duke salt Oh under iron slag one of

those drow was fellow named Cozens or

Lauren who was secretly undermining the

efforts of one of his colleagues and

turned against them at the final moment

uh so inside this iron flask is a fire

primordial called mogera the dawn type

and this primordial is such a powerful

entity that dude zalto needs it to

rebuild this giant Colossus now the

party withdrew or escaped from iron slag

and holed up in the Yaak folk village on

a shelf on the mountainside for the

night to rest up to get back all their

spells and hit points and at the end of

that rest period Worf

whom they helped rescue Jasper he cast a

divination spell that revealed that the

primordial was at that time no longer

trapped in the flask so the party set

into motion a a plot believing that the

drow were going to emerge from iron slag

having completed their delivery they

waited an ambush in the actual village

and succeeded at that ambush

they managed to attack Veera and her two

bodyguards jaws and sedap

and they forced the drow to surrender

but not before the earth tried to trap

Kharak your Dow I don't want to say

companion that's probably too kind of

word hey Jimmy a genie in your mitts you

tried to basically avira's tried to

capture the genie inside the iron flask

but failed that was the last straw and

she surrendered now d/f also proposed a

plot to break into two groups to split

the party as it were one group heading

off on a stealth mission into iron slag

while the other group stays outside the

gigantic doors the iron slag and mounts

a distraction and that other group was

called force right so let's pick up

where we left off with the surrender of

Erath and her bodyguards we are

technically still in the initiative

order and that brings us to evylyn to

confirm I have the magic armor back

right you do yes yes we were saving it's

won its daily use for the actual

distraction Oh were we where are we

Jared yeah yeah and it's also worth

pointing out in case you forgot that

Jasper the dwarf is no longer with you

early in the morning you sent him back

to citadel AD bar with waffles right for

a little baby

yeah I'm sure she'll be fine he was only

holding us back

something okay cool well so why nearest

when birra fails to trap the DAO inside

the iron flask and says we surrender

what do you do well of course you do the

lot of Lysander shines down upon us in

many ways and your redemption is soon at

hand welcome friends to the light and I

like

on the back and start to like bring them

into the phone hmm all right they stare

at you with some nervousness and disgust

like gently I take everything from them

so like the flask and their weapons but

not like I'm not like roughly taking it

I'm like the same way that you would

take someone's like umbrella as they

come in your door you know just like oh

yeah okay thank you

oh that's nice yeah yeah okay so uh you

are able to basically use your action to

take all their stuff yeah so you take

their short swords and their hand

crossbows you take the Earth's iron

flask and um let's see what else does

she have Trix will yell that if there's

any magic stuff I want it mmm

but she's not gonna leave behind the

wall okay you also find uh hanging on

various belt

evylyn what appears to be a small thin

spell book with black covers I can see

that I kind of like hide it behind my

back like I'm gonna surprise tricks with

it but when she says that she sees that

I'm like I wave it to her all excited

like I'm not coming over there you will

have to give it to me um I asked as I'm

holding the iron flask kind of like

turning it over looking at it and I'm

like hey France could you just explain

to me how this works like how do I use

it uh you actually saw feareth use it

when she tried to trap her ex so you

know exactly how it works basically you

pull out the stopper you utter the

command word which is 0th 0th that's

what I was looking for and I guess once

the thing is bound inside you plug the

flask again okay cool I like friendly

bring them over to DF and I'm like DF

this is are our new friends and I'll I

kind of wait for them to introduce

themselves and then I leave them with I

do that like really annoying thing we're

at a party and you're like hi so-and-so

this is so so nice for you guys to meet

and then I'm gone

and I go over to Strix and I give her

the spell book okay and the staff a

staff yeah there was a staff yeah I give

that to you too then

yeah she's got a slender black staff

with this spider at the top of it and

the legs of the spider seemed to run

down the length of the shaft

even's like really excited to give this

districts that's a good aesthetic she'll

take it yeah it's a when you hold it

Astrix in your hand the staff feels

sticky like when you pick up a mug that

maybe got some sticky food yeah thing

tricks his hands are already sticky so

he was like holding it like this as she

hands it over okay cool and then she

starts is also gonna be out you should

probably go tie them up before you give

me free stuff yeah I'll do you Scott I'm

their fan really yep that's your turn uh

and by the way we can drop out of

initiative any time you want to we're

just in it because we were sort of at

the tail end of combat but yeah I from

my standpoint I see how a reason to stay

an initiative okay but what you want is

completely different I'm out of

initiative I'm gonna sleep okay so let's

say we're out of initiative then okay uh

I'm keeping my blade out cuz I still

fully trust them especially since one of

them clearly is some kind of spell

caster and that could happen at any

point so if they try anything sneaky I

do want to be able to attack okay or at

least defend myself uh so well with that

uh directed at and I see they're they're

all hurt to one extent or another yeah

one of them was suffering a phantasmal

killer yeah oh that's true that has that

continued or uh so when they surrender

Kharak will discontinue it oh let me

just double-check if he can you might

not be able to yeah that's one last

right oh it's caught its concentration

so so he can live alright yeah

hi step forward and hopefully offer let

me simplify this for you I point to cha

and I say kill

ha ha I point as a death and I say kill

and I point to be wrath and say gag just

a little growl help from your favorite

drought uh wink I have no desire to end

their lives we'll need to save thousands

what if by ending two lives you could

save thousands that sounds like a

familiar conundrum that you might have

thought about before

yeah helping or hurting you and all this

help in the light of levander and

there's no reason to keep them around

these are your people in your mess how

you choose to handle it I'll leave that

up to you

oh sweet um we do need information from

them I'll turn back to Rosa named

feareth Mira Gareth

so to earth and 0th that appears the

lady in the command were two zeroes

correct

got it make sure I'm keeping up your ass

and 0th so I'll turn back to her and

really say the flask it's empty what

have you done with mogera she says I

have completed my test and delivered

McGarrett well he's doing this I want to

go about binding the drow so they can't

pose any problems or fight back when I

kill them later alright

you tie up truss and Zetas they do not

put up any resistance I'm good

were you there when it was released

where was it released to she says he has

found it to his adamantine Falls how

long ago was that she uh says about an

hour okay so it's still early we got

time

I think once you move quickly why the

delivery what was in this for you he

says this was my test of love as she

says that is if you expect to understand

and then when you sort of Anna raise

your eyebrows it sounds like I interject

as I'm binding Bharath and I say loft

hands down a test to growl of high rank

and if they fail they turn into dryers

and that's a drowning spider that's not

desired mm for them not for me yes Oh

interesting

Chris but do I have any reason to

believe that Eric could still fail her

test um you weren't exactly there when

the conditions were handed to her but

you think by delivering mogera she has

completed her test hmm fortunate and she

turns to you chosen and says what a

disappointment

you are you could have been a basis of

love instead you have turned your back

on this Spider Queen it played us for

yourself I smile helpfully and say so

long as no one makes it back to men's

oberyn's in no one will know I turned my

back on anyone Speidel Queen season

well I take out my dagger and ask if the

Spider Queen sees this and then I

execute choice okay um go ahead and uh

he's pretty helpless at this point yeah

spec's is still watching this from

behind the wall like all right um so uh

he really hates drawers that's awesome

yeah I he could have just taken the trip

we could have avoided this woman yeah

but he had a hero uh so just roll damage

as though you had scored a critical hit

all right I uh refresh my memory i i'm

using my rapier here so that's one d6 +

7 yep so so it's 2d 6 + 7 6 + 2 8 + 7 15

15 all right

you kill him you run through ha ha ha

so the the rapier comes out through his

back he collapses to his knees and then

as you rip the rapier out from him if

Paul's face first dead in the snow I

look at I look at D 8th and nod and say

good call DF maintains composure the

feareth just kind of rolls her eyes that

app is a little bit more wide-eyed at

that point and a little less in control

you can see that he just stares at you

angrily Couzens his his red pupils

trying to burn holes your head I draw I

point my rapier at Zenith and then it

drips with Chaucer's blood as you do and

then look at DF and say if you got

anything else to ask them I'd make it

quick because I'm on a roll you

do I do

back to beerus

the flask how many times can this be

used uh she says as you know NASA flask

is empty it can be you want some

creatures are more resistance and

defiant than adults they refuse to be

bound to it as you have just yeah look

what what's what happens to define

people mmm i wink not good yeah but like

it's not so charming this time I guess

since Trix is watching everyone getting

executed at this point she'll run over

with the staff and spell book and wave

them be like what do these do before you

die

Bharath will say that is a staff and

that is it look you'll hold that one and

you lead that one haha oh now we're

getting sassy lightning doesn't like

being insulted ya know for that I'll

execute that F alright uh so roll your

crit damage against him sex is like wait

I didn't mean that

Oh God 6 for 17 okay he dies oh I am

having a wonderful time with any more

jokes thank you for inviting me I mean

laughs is a pretty gross god anyway a

pretty gross that's it it's fixes

ladders and stuff already grow that's

bets that's your call about long this is

pretty gross not like the bane of all

light when that'th falls face-first in

the snow mira 'the disappears in using

an effect just a verbal only effect that

is basically a misty step spell Oh

strings falls our eyes yeah well and and

she

teleports herself onto the yak folk

village wall hey that's where I was

oh no I know what she's going to do so

let's roll initiative again dammit

oh man I was doing so good

you were doing quite well alright uh

strix I got nine all right yeah

thirteen evylyn hold on I wanted my

better dice uh twelve not that much

better

all right oh I can just bend a sweat

you're the natural one is not here I

roll I rolled a fifteen all right um and

okay oh boy hey right um so uh using

basically her surprise action she

teleports to the top of the wall about

thirty feet away from you at this point

uh then she's got to make it check uh

you see uh she took her staff you did

take her staff and her spell book is she

I take that that all right it's looking

something up very quickly I lick it so

she knows it's mine now oh now your

tongue is sticky yeah sticky man you

don't know you don't know what she's

been doing with that you don't know

where that's been strikes a hundred

percent does not care where things a bit

all right

is she sorceress origin story uh give me

a favor cozen and make a uh let's call

it a dexterity check why the is she

going after me yeah weird this is a

contested check you see that she's

struggling against the bonds

that you placed upon her oh I rolled a

ten plus three three decks all right she

is able to with her action slip out of

the rope bunks what a dig and so she's

used her bonus action and her action

which leads her move she will jump down

the backside of the wall so you can't

see her anymore she is now outside the

village hmm

and that brings us to you Couzens ah is

she worth pursuing at this point hmm uh

considering the stakes

probably not considering that I want her

to suffer probably uh so she's outside

the village yeah you can't see her at

present you'd in order to figure out

where she's gone you'd have to run let's

see well unless you were climbing over

the wall you'd have to run sixty feet to

the gates of the village throw them open

and look outside oh well that sounds

like work um I am going to opt to look

for cover instead okay there's abundant

cover in a burned-out wreck of a

building only about ten feet away from

you

burned out regular alright I'm going to

under the assumption that she's poor if

she's coming back she's probably going

to bring whatever she can to try to kill

us I'm going to run for cover

okay I'm gonna survive wait not gonna

take the bait are we I'm no okay so

Couzens runs and hides yeah I don't say

it like that

all right I am far concerned about her

returning with something or something

sneaky or even potentially going to

where the Giants so cunning action - I'm

going to chase after where she went -

all right so are you going to stay on

the ground run toward the gates uh yeah

that's 60 feet so you're - plus your

move will get you to the gates and you

can use another use your action to throw

the gates open okay I'll do that

okay you have to sort of pull the gates

open a little bit um through the snow

when you do and you peer outside you see

that she is moving down the stairs about

and she's about toe ten feet away from

you

ah she's like right there yeah she looks

like she's booking it yeah oh I am

faster than you are get rekt

all right uh that's my turn yeah uh yeah

okay um okay and you can see it's also

when you open the gates were kind of hit

by some cold wind that's blasting up

through the are down up through the

mountain up the mountainside and she's

all her robes and her hair's billowing

all over the place

yeah that's damn cold and then uh next

up is Evelyn I just lost my book um so

Jarrod is now thirty feet away from me

right because he took his whole running

action away from me he's 60 feet away

cuz he'll be dashed he - and I can't I

don't have like a line of sight on um

Gareth no beerus i do have the ability

to fly so if you regain altitude

probably gain line-of-sight to her okay

I'll do that I'm gonna take to the air

to give chase and also keep track of her

visually okay when you hop into the air

uh and fly upward diagonally you kind of

pass over the wall and you see her

thirty feet away from you down on the

steps outside of the Yakupov oh well if

she's thirty feet away

yeah then for the first time in our

entire campaign I'm gonna take one of my

javelins that have been mounted on my

back okay and toss a javelin

I told you add an arsenal yep as you

throw that you hear deaath audibly say

the hell I love the fan repeats song I

thought those were decorative they're

like those chopsticks you keep in your

hair yeah yeah yeah okay so you hurl a

javelin down upon her making sure I do

thakkaral oh it's only an 11 okay yeah

that that strikes the steps about four

feet dang it I'm out of practice

okay and then we come to Strix

alright everyone has left me correct

Oh actually you're not alone Kihara k--

the dow is you okay can I look at him

and be like dude can you I just go stop

that drow uh and he says this has

nothing to do with it alright I guess

I'll look in the spell book then since

he he's no use so I'll see what's in her

spell book alright you start to page

through what languages well it's arcane

language so you can figure it out

yes you can see that hey there are like

50 level smells in here

oh I I can't make an attempt to persuade

Cara can I you can on your turn health

action I'm gettin out of you and then

okay so when you're flipping through

Strix just making Arcana check for me

alright

I figure I can be more useful doing that

uh well also have pictures of happy

little spiders we got a 15 okay you can

see that there is a spell the title of

what it's a little beyond you you don't

quite get it but it's called cloud kill

nice but you also see that there are

some other spells that you do recognize

one is called Eve arts black tentacles

oh nice another one is called greater

invisibility

and then if you like astern turns a

super invisible yeah you can do it be

invisible and take actions yeah it's

more invisible than last time

you stay invisible even if you attack

and then there's like lightning bolt and

hey web and a few other spells you

instantly recognize like magic missile

and Mage Armor stuff like that cool you

want to complete list up spend more time

looking at it than just around sweet

which means I could learn the ones I

don't have correct sweet alright I get

very excited and I also enjoy the tiny

drawings of cute spiders yes so that

must be that's just my I'm just gonna

like I guess look for um look for any

like when he cover as well just kind of

like as my like Missy step just if I can

see any cover nearby oldest misty stuff

and just recover waiting for everyone to

come back yeah you can basically go into

the burnt-out shell of a yak full cut

okay and okay and paltin he just like

huh drinks from his flask not at all

surprised that she ran off after her two

bodyguards were murdered she sort of

holds it up to the horican car acts like

and then we come back to europe he turns

around glares up at evil in for hurling

that javelin in her direction and now

that her hands are free oh oh no well

theater kick slows but I just

instinctively live out my saving throws

oh my god yep um oh it's you okay

and it's you oh gosh she can't even know

yeah can't touch this done mmm-hmm her

alright her options are a slightly

limited because she can't get both

evylyn and yeah

in the same effect ha ha just like we

planned so she is going to cast lye on

herself and she leaps off the staircase

into the air and soars 60 feet away damn

I can't do that alright alright um and

that's all that she does and then DIAC

[Laughter]

scream a cuss word ever mmm trial

teacher try to give her emotional damage

who don't I don't know that's actually

force or not it may be free free deal

enough seamless of damage we can knock

her out of the sky

she has take she has taken some damage

she is um it looks like she's lost more

than half our hit points do I get two

attacks even when I use javelins Chris

uh you should you take a second one oh

okay

dang it I specifically thought to myself

don't forget your second attack I was

like you don't get that with javelins it

doesn't matter anyway I roll a seven

okay just yeah I'm just flailing them

all over yeah yeah alright you witness

evil I'm throwing away her javelins

what'd you do let me show her how it's

done and throw a dagger

all right you throw a dagger it's long

range for your dagger so yes

disadvantage on the attack role at six

feet oh I guess it is isn't it

that's really far you can do it no I

can't come on

Oh actually those were great 23 that's a

hit how's aim that is the power of

positive thinking

yeah I'm a grower hi max David nine okay

she is still alive but looking quite

seriously hurt I mean that gets her yeah

right through her thigh all right and

she begins to bleed copious amounts of

blood from the wound ha ha ha dad you

bud

yes ok so uh she was 30 feet away from

you now she's 90 feet away from you I

had written down on my character sheet

that I could have a longer range with

javelins but I don't remember how so

that's what I was looking at you're up

you're at long-range with javelins cuz

you can throw them out to 120 feet

that's what I thought okay um so yeah

I'm gonna go ahead and take that long

range javelin shot I have five of them

so I'm just okay chime yeah to attack

make to attack rolls with disadvantage

on each one okay

first well that's probably gonna be a

okay that's an eighth okay so that one

just kind of like I pull it out and

throw it that way and that's a that's a

not one Oh bingo again that one's like

I've reached for it it actually hit it

down and off my back just like clatters

to the ground yeah I have one remaining

javelin and I'm will this is why I've

never thrown your javelins before I'm

out of practice okay and all chosen what

do you do uh Kihara is right there yeah

yes all right I'm going to attempt to

persuade Carrick with my plus six

persuasion I mean I'm going to point out

that feareth is taking off likely to get

more drow you saw what she could do with

that flask she comes back she knows what

you are you're going right back in one

that's the flask by the way me you still

have that leaving I forgot about that

yeah wonder what the range of the flask

is

so I tried to I try to appeal to his

basically nature as a dhow okay um make

a make your persuasion check all right

that's 18 plus 6 says well this really

has nothing to do with me but in the

interest of friendship I will help out a

little

I'm helping guys haha he says but I want

something for my effort and easier

he will then fly it up into the air a

straight up 30 feet so he can get a

better read on the situation and uh he

says she is pretty far away without me I

mean you better you better get down very

fast but okay he in the interests of

friendship saccade what a great team

I don't and he'll begin to fly after her

and as he sort of flies through the air

this sort of uh sort of sand and sort of

leaves like a sand trail behind him Oh

his lower body turns into sand he's just

like this tornado flying through the air

and he begins to fly after her but not

very fast action it looks like he's

going as fast as he can Fist out but

Superman like yeah yeah exactly but yeah

he's not he's not wasn't what's

important is that I contributed you vote

wink let's let's all let's all just take

a minute to appreciate that

and he says don't start the other plan

without me as he flies on we should have

another plan yeah we should start the

other class tricks you right out by

yourself with cozen hiding nearby cool

I already looked through all the

spellbook I'm now gonna look at the

staff I'm just looking at this I got

just making our kind of check just

hiding in the book glanced at the staff

is she quite so helpful right now 21

okay the staff is really well-crafted

and can be used as an arcane focus but

is not a magical item all right

why can she tell why it's sticky is it

has in its creation uh the the whatever

magic shaped the staff also gave it kind

of a web-like stickiness oh it it's easy

to grab onto and not easy to wrest from

your hand so we are sure that the the

stick the it was made sticky at creation

it is not sticky after the fact it

doesn't have like like honey on her okay

good so what I'm saying is no one went

needed sticky know what made it sticky

that that was just I was just crucial

for me thank you have this six tricks

will just be like thick just drop it it

doesn't like to leave your head very

easily you're like ah so now she's just

in the corner to shake this thing off

[Laughter]

I'm sure cozen is laughing here too yes

you finally get it I find nothing funny

about this is it circles like you can

break it if you want I just pick it up

then I'll take it I'll take the right

Nick you got the sticky stick okay and

do you see carick flying slowly after

spirit overhead

oh and feareth is now way beyond your

dagger range oh well alright so is it

clear that she is flying much faster

than him yes she seems to be flying 60

feet around he's going well hit her flag

speed is 60 his is 30

well great she's gone

uh and even is still flying up above me

yep alright I'll start making my way

back towards tricks and cozen while

signaling evylyn to come to me as soon

as she can

they should probably signal Kihara

Caswell I don't think he's gonna catch

her um just just let him do it so this

novice give us a little bit first you'll

figure it out okay so you um are you

guys out of initiative again probably I

mean if we can't catch our own though

there's no blenders we got one javelin

you get your heart said I'm going after

her no evil ins kind of like pouting and

looking for her javelins that she

dropped

she's like collecting them and kind of

like Oh Sandra wants me be a better

servant I mean challenge make a

perception check okay no you find none

of them my perception is notoriously

horrible Carollo seven okay you find one

of them omean very sad can i good look

again right well forty nine sessions

from now when you're ready to throw

another javelin just wait is this forty

nine yeah what fifty is next time yeah

yeah cow focus oh it won't be alive we

die before fifty that would be the

saddest show's over by everyone oh my

gosh yeah okay well I sadly cradle my

well I sadly crossed my one javelin with

the one that's left and now I just have

to okay when you sink back down to the

ground the snowy ground with your

companions you have a moment where it's

just you guys by yourself no kaha wreck

no um cousins they're great no card you

would give me the flask I feel very sad

about the loss of my javelins okay give

me the flask okay I give it to ya that's

the flask all right and then I'll um

deal have you seen any of my javelins

just one second just by eye Robley ways

to stash that flask somewhere on me

that's easily hidden out of view on my

person if it come if it comes up that

somebody's looking for it I'll help me

make a stealth jacket all right cool all

right

I emerge from hiding and I so I think

that went pretty well

did you notice where any my javelin

spell oh my god I I just your helpfully

over to somewhere strix will find like a

big stick and be like hair use this it's

fine that's real that's real sweet

strikes thanks it's like this charred

piece of rafter for me no I'm just kind

of like holds it awkwardly for a while

until Strix isn't looking anymore there

you drop and you realize this all this

sort of black sentient black dog on your

hand it's like oh you're looking around

few javelins and Alton is just behind

you playing sad music alright cozen with

birth escaping does she have any legions

to the fire Giants oh no you you i

consider no we injured her pretty poor

pretty heavily Strix will hold up a

spellbook and be like do you think

she'll come back for this I'm probably

that would probably annoy her - I've

lost her spell book but he has no means

of recovering her spells she's heavily

wounded

I would I would theorize that she's

probably going to retreat somewhere to

recoup recuperate she has no real

standing to the fire Giants right in

these places that she could retreat you

from there because you get more allies

and return to us you're so out of the

way he chosen you had to travel through

miles and miles and

even get close to this rice it's gonna

take her weeks if not months to get home

she cow she could but by then we'll be

long gone all right great

so there's nonetheless she goes straight

to the fire Giants and warns them just

to spite us which she is already said

she had no allegiance to the fire Giants

why would she do that

I said she had no allegiance to the fire

Giants I didn't say she didn't have a

tremendous amount of spite towards us

mmm but we could tell she was flying

very much away from the mountain yeah

yes she had my best guy he's married

in a way that's still alright risk that

we probably can't take well we just

start the play out and just blow stuff

up distraction fast then there

where's Kihara cos dawn do go to wait

for him we're like I don't know uh

couple of spell buckets original sign it

yeah and Clark and palton going down

into stronghold and cozen strix and

evylyn outside mounting the distraction

it was deaath and cozen in the

stronghold yeah I was distraction okay

we don't have a cool team name like yeah

Clark was was trying to join our team

but I

you can I think cousin winked his way

out of it right okay okay

duh looking back up at Kihara cuz he's

still futile II pursuing you don't see

him from your vantage point anymore he's

got too far down the mountain

oh alright well good for him he's so

helpful well I'm sure he'll give up

eventually and you'll understand right

okay so how long would it take for

distraction for us to get down to those

doors probably about a half hour great

actually since yeah because Strix has to

kind of walk down the stairs ebloom can

fly but I can miss a step well you it

that's only gonna get you a short

distance oh okay nevermind awkwardly

walk down

stairs tripping on my robes yeah how

long would it take for us to re-enter

the mountain and descend back down that

chimney so if you were to go by okay

back down the chimney you say okay if

you were to take that route you'd have

to go through back through through the

mines and then follow your path back to

the mines to that cavern move we already

moved the rock and then go back down the

chimney you think that would take you

about two hours if you didn't encounter

anything right okay that's that path

then if we take the in a direct path

would be down down the elevator shaft

all the way to the bottom of the strong

hole and assuming you weren't held up in

the shaft for some reason probably get

down there in about a half hour all

right

we know that elevator isn't working go

to anything that would help us quickly

descend usually reassigned elevator

shaft

uh descend yes RIA send not so much I

can levitate so theoretically I could

levitate both of us down there

okay levitate yourself well yeah but I

could carry him right no I can't no

right I have a way to descend great oh

yeah so you have to choose the target

and that creature can levitate oh I can

I can help him descend actually nor is

it self says in that it says in the drow

entry self only self only god Daniel

what if you put D F in the flask and

carried him down like that and then LEM

out well I've met the board like that I

could works exactly like I am I'm from

existence no it works you can put

anything in there what if what if we use

choice and death and throw them down

there to create a softer landing not

only works in cartoons when you Jim yeah

I'll think mush is gonna make that much

so you just want to throw someone off a

cliff to our so mean well there there

are other corpses here right like yak

folk I think you should get in the flask

dear no yes yeah actually you are right

Jared that the target of the iron flask

must be a native to a plane of existence

other than the one you're on oh do you

know you were born here do you

I thought you knew magic I do know magic

are you sure you were born here positive

hmm how dare you if you get them to

another plane then it'll work you did

yeah this this plan cannot fail strikes

just like so it's just likes like

leafing through the spell book yes if

you can that it's a bit more time

studying the spell book you get an exact

list of the new spells it's a mage hand

we're sorry major armor magic missile

shield which bolt alter self misty step

web why lightning bolt Eve ARDS black

tentacles Raider in biz cloud kill call

for the ones after which bolt again it

was which bolt I didn't write fast

enough after which bolt I said alter

self oh that's right already have misty

step which you already have web okay

then then fly and a lightning bolt and

cloud coil go I'm good yep cool so I can

now cast those from studying them cuz I

have the book uh so you sent you'd have

to spend well you're a sorcerer yeah so

can I cast them once or what I just know

them so what I'm smart you know as a

sorcerer you don't yes use spell books

Oh could I um but like the spells that

you know like you can I'll let you swap

them out okay cool yeah sweet well I'm

excited as long as they're on your spell

list got it cool I point to evil in and

look to the earth and say can't you just

borrow her boots ah didn't you just use

those boots miss now I'm harder to see

on the ground hmm he had the weapon but

my boots okay other thing I could do if

I could turn you into a cloud and you

could go in a jar and then Couzens could

carry you down you can also fly down as

a cloud yeah so you just cloud you no no

let's let's stick with the jar plan

just stop the jar thing though restricts

don't you have to be there to unclog me

I mean I can just like count just be

like one two three four that might be a

problem because if you were halfway down

you might then oh right

we're taking the long way okay but

there's also like a stairway next to the

elevator shafts like there's also be if

Jacob that path that leads down to the

mines yeah yeah is that any shorter or

faster than the chimney route is that

basically this that's essentially the

route okay so because we first entered

the forge through the mines but not that

chimney path in fact slightly longer

that way uh it's about the same okay I

think our best bet is going down through

the chimney

since I figured they would probably

expect us to be coming from the front

passages or saved a pre-notice a heavy

amount of smoke coming from the chimney

then we can have that way to us we have

options oh wait I also have um in the

spellbook

I have fly and I can use it like a

scroll so I can cast fly on you oh great

but did you don't have to go in a jar is

that good that would work okay since we

know you don't like going in jars yes

that one's imprisoning me thank you okay

so you use your fly squirrel yes so I

cross that off I read it from the thing

and I give it to Deus you can fly now we

what do you do like a little jump oh

yeah give it a lower Oh quick Chester

Rooney I've never done before

yes when it's it's yeah you're flying

without wings or you were just

sailing through the air in fact you're

going about as fast as beerus did when

she cast the fly spell on herself now go

get her I mean like yeah yeah even like

flies around him trying to give him tips

okay you have ten minutes on the hips -

yeah it's all hips

Oh ten minutes yep okay we've got to go

alright cozen use levitate we'll go down

to that mineshaft stay close stay quiet

and stay on seeing the rest of you head

starting towards that door it'll 5 when

do we distraction force I'm trying to

remember how long was it if we take the

so the draw path if you're flying down

the shaft not long at all you'll get

down there in minutes

okay so okay it'll take strix longer

they're welcome to run down there

alright well we can get down there and

stay hidden until you guys are ready to

act absolutely okay let's do that so

well done the shaft the rest of you get

into position and then Suze you're ready

start well I think I'll have a good idea

of when it happens and that's when COEs

and I will make our move

find mogera so if the door opens and all

that happens all

once do we all just re meet at the door

and then just beat cheeks out of here

right my escape route for my cozen

myself is after we destroy that heart

we're coming out those front doors

meeting okay guys we are both definitely

surviving great it misterx you got that

extra personal use anything you can to

stop them slow them down bottleneck them

within that doorway and just blast them

with everything you go I will I believe

you

evylyn you can use that to use go and

vulnerable and you just have at it it'll

be a Grandal time for you hmm

palton try to use crown of madness to

get to the turn against each other uh

if they start getting close fend them

off a thunder wave sure and then when

you guys meet up with card just tell

them to attack them as well you just

need a bite you seen a buy us enough

time until uh we've got this done then

we'll go alright go your flies running

out all right cuz let's move alright I'd

hurry to keep up with all right mr. Phil

[Music]

yeah flies into the stronghold flies

over the top of the shot elevator shaft

leading down through the sort of flies

through the struts that form a dome a

lattice dome over the top of the shaft

that all the machinery was mounted to

and then begins to Y spiraling downward

into this big shaft and cozen throws

himself off and levitates behind him

well I didn't get a fun description as

well regular cast guest cast as you

descend this dark shaft you realize it's

it's a big wide ever descending cylinder

of darkness there uh it goes down and

down and down and down for hundreds upon

hundreds of feet you do pass by a level

the shaft which has an iron gantry anga

and iron gantry circling around its

outer rim this you believe is the upper

level represents the upper level of the

forge there are two wide hallways

leading off but the shaft continues down

goes down about another forty feet

before you hit the elevator lift which

is just sort of suspended there can't go

up or down but there are gaps all around

it so that it doesn't impede your

descent and about 40 feet below that you

hit bottom and at the bottom of the

shaft there are two wide passageways

40-foot wide

40-foot high passageways one clearly

leading into the dining room a huge huge

long dining room with big basalt tables

fire pit and fireplace at the far end

that seems pretty unoccupied a quiet

even but the other passage after about

40 feet leads into the assembly area

where the colossus is and you guys can

hide out in that hallway if you want to

it do we know exactly where the forge is

because we seen it before did we yes it

is in the assembly area um on the lower

level or top on the lower level or low

okay on the level that you're on so you

can still see that there the they

haven't cleaned up the wreckage of the

toppled Colossus yet it's it's still

lying on the ground providing ample

cover you can see that there is it

pretty much dominates half of the the

floor area the other half of the floor

area is dominated by the adamantine

Forge which looks like a giant sort of

tapering cone made of adamantine that

rises up from the floor it's about sixty

feet in diameter and about sixty feet

high and smoke is billowing from the top

it and it is putting out so much heat

right now the entire assembly area is a

blast furnace I was worried about that

the heart still hangs from a giant chain

off of a large crane on the far side of

the hall about a hundred and twenty feet

okay and about 80 feet up alright so

once we're down there let's hide and get

ourselves into position there are fire

giants in this area or don't you see you

can see that no sign of the royal family

but you do see there is a fire giant

standing on a gantry not too far from

the crane controls the heart and there

is a fire giant standing near the

furnace they don't seem bothered by the

heat at all of course not right I've

Stealth's my way through this place

before something a pretty good idea of

where good hiding places are so that's

where I'll lead chosen to as make a

start to hide and wait for distraction

force make a smell each of you make a

stealth check to avoid the detection of

the fire giants I'm going to give you

advantage because you're small and there

is a the the sound of the fire inside is

quite loud look okay well I want you to

know this is with advantage but one of

them was still a one okay but the other

one was 22 I'm just a good uh I rolled

15 okay I'm sorry twenty-three I got

that luck stone alright uh you are both

able to find hiding places and you don't

think the fire giants noticed you at all

and you're just waiting for distraction

force you sure are alright so strix you

make your way down the steps

there's snowy and icy and a bit slippery

oh the wind is a rip

through and catching your your robes

know you're holding on your hat my hat

yeah exactly you're having a heck of a

time making your way down I would like

you to make a dexterity check for me oh

yeah I didn't do too bad uh sixteen okay

you're able to manage the stairs just

fine

yay despite the adverse weather

conditions I also keep up a steady

stream of chatter at her the whole way

down

sir my church can't hear it it's a windy

one probably a distraction for Lysander

Rix I make a check for palton as well

and he is able to hold his feet about

halfway down the stairs kharak uh

returns flying his lower body still a

whirlwind of sand and he just sort of

hovers nearby and says the draw woman

slipped through my grasp that's fine

good job trying he says we are headed

down to make the destruction force

business now right that's right yeah I

need to remind you that our primary goal

is the recovery of the iron golem yes

alright but distraction forces primary

goal is distraction that's right uh and

he says I will meet you at the bottom

okay and when you get when you get to

the bottom he's got his legs back and

he's just standing there and then you

walk over to the base of the mountain

side where the gigantic 80-foot tall

doors are um and the ground sort of

slopes up toward them and you find

yourselves standing outside of these

gigantic doors great Kharak who do fire

Giants not like other Giants they do not

get along well with frost giants great

so strikes will like ringer hands and

make a silent image I almost forgot uh

Couric shows you guys something yeah

you didn't have before I wrote it down I

forgot to mention it he has harsh Nags

big axe hot cool

whoa I found this after the drought

woman got away can you wield it

it was stuck in the ground he says it's

big but I like it I like big weapons too

I think you and I are gonna get along

just fine

Trix is this like all right uh so first

thing is she's gonna make a silent image

of like an army of frost giants or as

many as she can in the size that she

makes in front of the door oh sorry

what's Mellie using a silent image

silent image so it's a well it can be so

it's a 15 foot cube so they'd have to be

kind of a small set of frost ice well

maybe they're far away

those are like miniature frost giants it

says you can create the image of an

object a creature okay so other visible

phenomena just one really mean looking

for us giant one short mean-looking yeah

like I really like and he's mad that

he's short

- oh so like they're also really scary

all right so you do create a silent

image of a mad short yeah giant that's

just so that they can't really see

through the door that's my goal at least

make like a look so they can't see me

behind the frost giant got it so you're

using it as a bad obstacle yes way yes

to break line of sight exactly that's

exactly what I'm doing excellent all

right and any other preparations you

want to make um all right we did that I

would silent image by the way is a

concentration spell it will last up to

10 minutes okay cool um I can cast as

well though or is it just like only

thing I can cast if you cast another

spell that requires concentration right

lose your silent okay

okay um all right so got that that's

pretty much all I wanted to do there

just prepare that and then I have mage I

do my mage armor

and I think that's it getting ready um

actually this might be fun you know what

I'll save that I'll say that oh wait

also might well know I'll say that you

never mind

I'm just started just standing at the

door going no wait no should I do this

no I really do this I think she's ready

all right and I'll back up as far as I

can

unto some sort of like high perch so I

can cast a fireball on the door okay so

you hurl your fireball at the door and

it explodes against the barrier

engulfing it in smoke and flame briefly

inside over the roar of the forge you

guys hear this sound from the other side

of the door is a sortable and uh the

fire giant on the gantry heard it and

just sort of tilts his head like you see

if it was something he should be worried

about fee fie foe fum people uh can I

tell correct to hit the door with the

axe

uh yeah he'll uh he'll take it up and he

will smash this big axe into the door

and when it strikes the door it does

kind of make a an enormous sound and

those of you inside the forge can hear

this large clunk sound oh good working

Damien gave me a fire giant on the

gantry makes his way around and down the

metal steps to the ground floor and

actually kind of puts his head up

against the door Niharika looks back to

you and sort of shrugs his shoulders

do it again I meant come on hit it again

his head bunk alright the fire giant

hears it kind of startles him

snaps his head away from the doors a bit

and shouts to the other giant or someone

outside Paula Duke is there any way that

I see a magical barrier on the door

correct you see him there I mean the

door is magically sealed right so if I

did dispel magic on it could it possibly

get rid of the barrier uh you don't know

all right I'm gonna do that while he's

hittin it I'm like keep hitting it with

the axe I'm gonna magic it yeah let me

just also look at paulsen and be like

Thunder Wave whenever you want it might

be helpful okay uh your spell has no

effect on the door all right sorry

can you do anything about this card you

have magic too you do magic you're made

of magic I don't know

it's okay strikes you tried your hardest

I don't need your pity it's not pity

it's love uh yeah yeah and cozen you see

that that the fire giant by the Forge

disappears through a set of doors about

10 minutes later you hear noises of more

fire giant voices from somewhere deep in

the complex like they're like they are

actually organizing or doing something

like glance the da/sa this could be your

chance

or who you write there as they return

and make things worse well alright if

you want to be a party-pooper about it I

[Music]

I better bring their attention to the

door so they're not even looking at us

or having a chance to come this way

first not yet

okay uh about two minutes later striding

into the assembly hall you see fire

Giants encased in iron armor including

the Duke who's got a big iron helm now

fitted over his head which has this sort

of plume of fire spewing from the top of

it great and he's got his second ball

and they come stomping into the area and

then there are a total of LaDuke plus

three others can we hear them stomping

on the other side of the door nothing

you hear nothing outside okay I'm a DF

and Couzens they walk kind of right past

you big heavy steps clanking armor you

can see that they've also got uh each

two hellhounds on chains except the Duke

so there are six hellhounds and four

fire giants that is a lot that's a lot

well be fine Dean stands in front of the

doors and says something in giant yes

what is this word that only fire Giants

can speak uh he seems to be speaking a

phrase uh do any of you speak giant

either of you uh I don't believe so no

all right

then you're not sure what he bellows

exactly you can sort of hear the

syllables but you don't know what they

mean as the doors crack open and those

of you who are outside see the door

split open and begin to open away from

you into mountain perfect quite a moment

for me to tell you about the lad of look

in there I'm like get away from the

doors why would kill right on the doors

you can't cast Coco oh I can't that's

right okay web Zen okay so you're going

to try to stretch so the web spell are

you going to string it between the doors

is that your plan as just to make the

ground sticky to halt their movement mmm

okay um yes you can basically fill if

the webs aren't anchored between two

solid masses or layered across I guess

you're layering it across a floor yeah

okay that you can do and you can set

those over a flat surface to a depth of

about five feet okay and it's a 20 foot

cube now the doors themselves are 50

feet wide all right um she's just gonna

put it in the center yeah I'll just put

it in the center wait hopefully they

don't see it in their rage a mass of

sticky webs appears as the doors split

open those of you standing outside sea

or iron encased fire Giants one of them

bigger than the other three and six

hellhounds on chains everyone roll

initiative and one tiny pissed-off

fostering yeah don't forget

oh he's part of your gang not there yeah

don't forget how angry is to be tiny hmm

I got in eleven eleven for Evelyn I

rolled in 11 okay uh

14 14 restricts 12 for youth 12 for DF

and Bolton is also an 11th AHA rec rolls

a 8 and the Duke rolls a 17 oh come on

can you just roll badly for once

yeah why can't you be like the rest of

us if he hates us that's why the Duke is

anyone against their team always rules

great yeah

okay uh so one the door is part and the

light shines through he sees bending

before him eight evening or not he

playing a frost giant little on the

short side very angry looking and a

spider tattooed drow oh not a drow they

paltin with bagpipes and then evylyn

with tiny feathered boots flying and

smiling yeah uh he the duke sort of his

shoulders sag uh and he will uh uh lift

his mall and say something in giant

which I believe strikes you speak giant

uh I don't but I have tongs so right but

you haven't cast it though I've not

casted so I will not understand him

right so he says something and then uh

does it sound nice no well that's close

enough

Giants let the hellhounds go and the

hellhounds come running out at you

they can't since you're flying evil in

there's not a heck of a lot they can do

to you good great but since there are

six of them three of them will throw

themselves at paltin and three of them

will throw themselves at your illusion

and end up going right through it

all they made an attack so joke's on you

dogs yeah our um our health is animals

they are fiends okay Oh didn't even get

webbed that's a very good question

no they're gonna run around the web damn

now that's smart they roll the nineteen

on their perception check so yes they

skirt around the web they come at you

your illusion disappears as they attack

it halten will be fun

uh they just sort of pounced on top of

him and take him down to the ground and

you hear the sound of like like bagpipes

oh my god honking and uh oh no one of

them uh sort of picks him up in his jaws

and shakes him like a rag doll throws

him up in the air and the other two sort

of counts on him catch him and drag him

down to the ground again what these are

some extremely organized hellhounds yep

you're mad and then and then one of them

breathes fire all over paltin oh my god

holy Sh evylyn does not like this

alright Politan takes 21 points of

damage all right and so palton is being

torn apart and incinerated by the

hellhounds whereupon the three

subordinate fire Giants come striding

forth they roll on their perception

checks and walk around the the webbing

that's fine I guess everyone's is real

smart today yep

and as they come out uh they can do

nothing except close the distance on you

they're not as fast as the hellhounds so

they are now towering before you Strix

and you evylyn stir stir in one probably

Armour even hears that and just kind of

goes tink whatever hours you turn it on

alright and that is their turn which

brings us to Strix great oh it is time

for a retreat of the ages right now run

away

uh I'm going to go ahead and the misty

step as far away as I can get okay you

can miss you step thirty feet back as

there need tall things I can get on uh

nope but so just regular that's all it's

all cleared here this great okay well I

will do that and then I was I'll be like

uh like a mound of snow that you could

essentially miss the step into or behind

perfect I will go behind a mound of snow

all right that you can do and that was

my bonus action

and then I will try to do I'm going to

try to uh Otis's hold on I'm checking to

see what saving this is I'm going to try

polymorph the Duke okay so he has got to

make I believe this is a con say or

wisdom say if I don't remember yeah I'm

checking right now it's a wisdom it is a

with sub saving process good what are

you going to try to polymorph him into

oh my gosh so many choices a chicken not

right uh the Duke turns into a chicken

as my tiny giant disappears a tiny

little silky chicken with all right with

that black feathers yes yeah yep all

right so the Duke is a chicken that was

unexpected and he he he uh dear yes

alright so the forge is now unguarded uh

yes all of the fire Giants are either

outside or a chicken okay okay boom so

with that wiping sweat from our brow it

turned over to cows and be like like now

and then uh uh uh dad yeah I'll make my

way up to the forge okay so is it the

fort so uh okay so you're going to go to

the forge not the heart got it right

okay so you rush up to the forge the

heat that it's putting out is absolutely

intense yeah feel the skin on your flesh

just becoming parched and Dan that's hot

blisters start to appear what do you do

when you get there okay there's a big

there's a big giant door uh like a great

true which you can see a fire so bright

you can't look at it right um use the

flash I I don't because the flasks work

through great Oh

so the great is not preventing

line-of-sight okay so as long as it has

line yes yes and you can see a

malevolent pair of eyes in the middle of

that fire great uh so with that I'll

leave else Allah say as I'm I kind of

like doing this like mogera no one

wishes to be imprisoned and I am here to

set you free

with that flask 0th all right now she

has to make a wisdom saving throw

I hope she fails I tried to help make it

son like a good so that she would feel

harder fail harder all right like you

want this trade one prison for another

hmm it's a better prison okay she is

plus seven on this role what yeah it

goes ready no no no is ever ready I'm

walking away turns gone he nope T okay

I have Rajic purchase I have rolled what

if I don't what I rolled all right

mogera is drawn into the iron claw a

success put down the bingo board and

from the far side of the Ford you hear a

little alright um yes so all that heat

and intensity the heat of a Sun

practically gets sucked inside and you

plug you put this bronze brass stopper

back on the iron flask and you feel none

of that creatures heat emanating

pressure from within it alright and

that's good for you because at the end

of your turn you would have taken a

bunch of fire damage yeah I was prepared

for that the whole time I was not yeah

that was one of the things I chose not

to tell the party good for me for

hanging bags what I'm alright uh then it

is this Cozens turn uh I say tidy

you unleash that thing it's friendly to

you for one hour but I'm guessing it and

I could hear the gobble gobble is right

yes

yeah you would have seen the Duke sort

of this this magic spiral around him and

sort of reduce him down of any kind he

would have disappeared from view okay

well I say I can't assume that things

are going wrong but I'm hearing a

chicken so perhaps you should move

sooner rather than later you probably

also hear Strix wait oh you little

chicken I point out uh we saw six

hellhounds go out there in three fire

Giants your friends can't keep that up

know if the kid why not distract the

distraction with another distraction

unleash maggara they will have their

hands full with the mountain exploding

and we can run forever yep the voice of

evil and says but what about the slaves

hey there's tons of dwarves we can

always get more all right is death

haunted by the realization that he just

sentenced millions of innocents to death

no it's just a decision he wasn't ready

to make until he was forced to make it

whoo I got fun cozen you are you haven't

taken any actions that are you just

essentially using your turn to hdf I

mean what else do you want me to do uh

no it's entirely for you you don't have

to do anything obviously if you were to

engage the enemy they would know you

were there so yeah no I don't want to do

that because I've been surviving so well

so far yeah I guess I can't really do a

persuasion check do you have to convince

him to kill a bunch of people I do I

know where the slave wheel is from where

we currently stand um yeah based on

geography you have a fair idea

it's on the level above you think the

quickest way to get there is to take the

iron steps that are in this hall up to

the Gann up to the gantry and there is a

portcullis hallway leading off of that

that might go there you've never been

that way but just geographically it

looks like it might lead there okay if

he's looking cross I say remember we

don't know how long it takes for this

thing to explode you can still save your

friends or to slaves whatever your your

dwarves you can get all your doors if

you want baby possibly or they'll all

die

also you can still fly I think maybe

yeah it hasn't been ten minutes right

now I think it has a few guys going down

the mountain oh yeah yeah it's probably

expired at this point yeah all right uh

evylyn yes you've activated your armor

mm-hmm so you're invincible and then

snow you see six hellhounds three of

them were attacking the illusory giant

which is gone and three of them are on

palton who hasn't taken this turn yet I

and yeah right in front of you there are

three fire Giants gee whiz I definitely

would try to save paltin so I'm going to

cast find steed okay

and I'm gonna call in the light of

Lysander with the blessings of the

morning Lord I call upon you mighty

steed Morning Glory and then she crawls

out of the ground it like a light

shining entrance and then I wink at her

and s a distraction for us and she when

he's gone miss winking you're not gonna

pay off yeah okay oh she understands

that to mean that I want her to distract

the hellhounds and protect paltin okay

that's what I'm trying to tell her got

it

all right um yes

and so the horse goes prancing off

toward paltin and sort of collapse

around um

dazzling the hellhounds sort of struck

by this creature and then goes uh

mutters this a whinny challenge yeah she

wants to race yeah and catch me

okay oh and as the horse bolts off the

hellhounds bound off after her aha

distraction forest men in there all

right palton goes up next he's like

thank you you're welcome I love you I

mean what you will sit up and cast a

spell at the Giants and this is a fear

spell and it has I think it's a cone

think I remember correctly yes each

creature in a 30-foot cone so all three

are two of the Giants have to make saves

two of the Giants are frightened good

bye bye paulten spell they tremble in

their iron clad boots and on uh it's on

their turns it looks like they're going

to run away

so um that brings us to Couric kharak

seeing this will challenge the third

giant and bring his axe to bear against

it

swinging twice hitting twice with Gert

with harsh nags great axe and dealing

damage to that fire giant and next up is

the Giants two of the Giants go running

back in to the iron slag Assembly Hall

chicken bar uh oh yeah one literally

chicken double meaning well yes and they

they sort of stop and look down at the

chicken where they're Duke used to be

bond running it just it just freaks them

out more no moral support from that

chicken yes so they actually run toward

UDF in terror ah and that's all they can

do the third one is going to go to town

on Carrick and is going to hit the genie

twice who cares

good can he hear you going who cares

yeah yeah so this is actually good for

you guys big sack of hit points um okay

so Carrick and this giant are bashing

the crap out of each other

with axes and swords and that brings us

to Strix

yeah I'm really pleased about the

chicken so I'm just giving myself a pat

on the back

yeah are the hellhounds there still

still three hellhounds that have not

been dealt with correct correct three of

them have been lured away by Morning

Glory and three of them have not been

dealt with yet okay you're sniffing

around for you actually I'm sure they

are um you're really easy to sniff out

in fact you're kind of creeping up on

you cuz you're dirty

not as me I'm dirty well I'm gonna

gaseous form and fly up okay

away from away from these all Hauser's I

know that my magic can't really do

anything against them because their fire

so right as as they sorry go ahead

I was gonna say as they pounce on you

you turn to gas and fly out of their

range and also rude gesture as a cloud

okay so how you can fly about what 10

feet up in the air you move 10 feet

around

yeah I'm pretty slow but I okay um yeah

uh the hellhounds we'll look around for

a more tantalizing target and hey

there's paltin I just got the hellhounds

on yeah and more hellhounds yay idea yes

you're up make the right decision TIA

shut up laughs and all right hmm did you

think this hard when you killed that

child yes thank you you're welcome

Cynthia's conscious I like it well my

conscious laughs at me all right I'll

look over to Cosette and say go help the

others and I'm gonna start cutting

action - and start making my way up the

stairs - where the the slave wheel is

okay you begin to you you basically have

to run almost the length of the Assembly

Hall so you're not even gonna get to the

stairs this round Jesus all right mm-hmm

you haven't let the like a thing out yet

have you no you still got it locked away

in his hand

okay so DF Sprint's across the floor of

the assembly hall between the legs of

the

fleeing fire Giants effect it's I Alton

so fast yep and then SCO's n' uh yeah

this DF is doing something unexpected

yeah I scream at DF what the hell are

you doing the hearts right here

though the hearts up there I'm going up

for it I don't know if I believe that

probably not you come from a highly

suspicious society so I look him dead in

the eyes I can with how far he's moved

away and say last chance DF everyone

dies or you do the right thing can still

do the right thing and save them do I

see any conviction in his eyes here

he seems convicted hmm he's got a set

I'll at least have to try

he's got the furrowed brow of

determination all right I look at him

and nod stoic Lee and then when he turns

to go on his way I'm just gonna leave

okay

leave via the open big giant open doors

ya know I was really only in it for the

heart and it was like I didn't work out

yeah I'm not gonna leave bye though now

that the hearts no longer in it you're

like okay well like he doesn't look like

he's and I don't want to chase him plus

yeah this whole I've got a cousin to

kill all right

so you head toward the entrance and you

can get there and see the battle

unfolding outside with three hellhounds

creeping toward paltin three more

chasing after a magical horse that

you've never seen before a beautiful

shining state evil and flying in the air

and a dhow duking it out with a giant

hmm okay the chicken and right next to

you is a little black chicken right do I

have any reason to suspect that this

chicken is the Duke you absolutely

believe that chicken is the cow I'm

gonna grab that chicken okay you grab

the chicken all right can I do anything

else or do I just have it that would be

basically your attack so you're done you

wrap up the chicken it's really soft

in case anyone like I use me I'm going

to like appeal to some

census and hold the chicken up like a

zit shield like don't don't don't

with me I did you have a hostage people

in your up

so is Paulson still under attack he has

he's not been jumped yet by the three

other hellhounds but he's about to be

I just I'm gonna spend this whole time

protecting for a little paltin um I oh I

forgot what I was gonna cast you have

any chicken based magic I had one I

thought I had hot chicken based there's

something that I can do that does extra

damage there it is okay

divine smite so I'm gonna try to melee

attack with tree bane um the the

hellhound that looks closest to paulten

and I'm also trying to distract them

from him as a target I'm trying to take

them on me yeah you can essentially land

right in front of them I roll a natural

one oh okay well you second one tonight

you get a second attack so that first

one I like I'm trying to get tree beam

but I accidentally stuck the javelin in

on top of it so I call my god yep okay

so that one is an 19 okay you do hit the

hellhound with the second attack so I'm

gonna catch divine smite and so I get to

do 2d 8 plus 1 D 8 per spell level

radiant damage plus 1 D H because it's a

feed correct so first my normal damage

is 9 plus 2 d 8 is another 8 so 16 17

right 17 um plus a one d 8 personal

level it's just 1 so 2 more okay thank

you and then one d8 for undead and fiend

is 7 ok

nice 26 points of damage don't hurt my

friends all right

you basically bloodied that hellhound

with one swing and it lets out of loud

Yelp they go right after you and three

of them will all breathe fire on you I

need you to make three dexterity saving

throws but remember I have the

invulnerable armor on never mind

oh it hurts so bad yes you are immune to

the damage and it washed the flames wash

over you

ah the searing light of life and also

bathe in it and the dogs is like halton

blasts you and the dogs with thunder

wave what make it won't be hurt a good

Constitution saving throw me yep uh-huh

twelve are not hurt but you are blown we

need away from him all three dogs oh you

and them all go tumbling into a pile

don't let God as palton cast is massive

thunder wave spell killing one of the

hounds and seriously damaging bloodying

the other two I'm like all tangled up

and I can't hurt sunshine all right and

uh horik goes next and he's duking it

out with a fire giant long story short

they both hit each other once and

continued to damage them and then he car

says I need to go find they golem one of

you take this guy for me so bossy it was

strikes two Strix yelled and be like hey

can you summon one of those isochoric

will say put down that chicken and get

over here now one of your things

please but that's his turn and we are

back up at the top with the Giants or

specifically the chicken who can't do

well

Yeah right I guess he could pick me if

he wanted I guess check-in I don't even

think he has a save I think he's just a

chicken

yeah he's the chicken for the duration

mmm he's a chicken for an hour

uh-huh all right uh yeah so um yeah it's

trying to Peck you it's not very

effective all right clearly seems like a

hostile chicken oh uh Ellen you're

attacked by the two surviving hellhounds

but they can't chew through you or your

armor oh oh oh oh oh strix you're up

great so I am a cloud you're a cloud

high enough to where they can't see me

but I just I still want to find a high

up perch if I could yeah you can find

essentially a Ledge on the mountainside

where you could stand above the doors

all right preferably and not Isilon next

to the doors because you're actually

flying very soon yeah okay so I'll just

go find a Ledge that I can perch on okay

you want to stay gaseous or turn it's

all out at that point

um if I get to the ledge I will turn

Saul I'll say you're on the ledge in

your solid okay great I think that's my

hole yep my whole thing so okay uh yeah

yes you get to the stairs and you start

to bound up them you reach the top of

the stairs at the end of your turn okay

can I see you down the hallway or

anything you can see you're about 20

feet away from the hot the entrance to

the hallway which has a big iron

portcullis that you could easily slip

through okay so that does my cunning as

my - cunning action move yeah can I use

my last my standard action to move

another 30 feet the other thing is it

stick okay yeah so you can get just

inside the portcullis yeah just so I

have a pretty good idea of where I'm

going and I'm pretty sure this is where

the slaves are um you kind of get the

sense that you are head in that

direction you there's a you are now in

the middle of a 30-foot hallway that

seems to open into a large chamber and

you can hear sounds emanating from the

chamber that suggests

on giant voices great marketing to

artisan such-and-such okay

by the way they got bingo which row I

don't know but they did it okay and DF

as you appear around the corner you see

a long chamber that has at the far end

of it another hallway blocked by another

portcullis but in the chamber itself you

see rows upon rows of cells big iron

cells full of dwarves and gnomes God how

come what are we talking like three

there are one two three four five six

seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

thirteen big cells all of them have

giant locks on them maybe one of your

keys works so like we say giant locks

you mean like the keyholes and cells are

physically large like a giant-sized yes

they're a design for a fire giant to put

a fire giant key in open right and then

my thieving tools probably have they

would not be effective but without

thieving tools you think maybe with this

advantage you could try to pick one

manually by literally sticking your arms

in to manual launch the tumblers grating

go wrong at all

all right awesome cool great my turns

done but you know it'll take you forever

to unlock them all yeah go away from you

now go away from cozen you said yes run

up the iron staircase and disappear into

an upstairs hallway yeah Nadia let me

down there um you got the chicken yeah

and I have a chicken so I came out on

top really um

do I see any obvious avenues of escape

from this whole thing oh yes you could

essentially walk out the doors and kind

of slink off down a mountainside and

nobody would be a none the wiser all

right um

would it take me anything to

would it take me in action to hurl or

kill this chicken yes you could drop it

as a free action yeah and I'm just gonna

drop this chicken he never he never

appreciated me no there was no love it

and Kharak said asked me to help him

right yes all right I give him the drow

sign for sure thing buddy and then I

leave okay you can make a stealth check

if you want to slip away unseen all

right still plus three dexterity I

rolled it - haha evils like where are

you going everybody's like what is he

going I say I'm going to help DF while

running in the opposite direction

alright that's seriously confusing to

some of you they have bigger problems

yeah they do I figure we are a little

busy I'm just the guest you guys have a

quest to finish that's true don't get

distracted by the guy running away

alright so chosen as you make your way

up to Sarah tisha Slee down the

mountains and through the snow you're

you're basically a charcoal skinned guy

in white so everything around you is

completely white so it's like hmm yeah I

guess stealth not no not gonna but you

you leave the battle and sort of make

your way down through some snow and ice

covered mountain crags well away from

the danger you hear Kihara cursing

because you didn't come to his aid you

can hear evil and laughing at these

hellhounds who are trying to bite her

playing with the puppies yes and off in

the distance you see sort of a weird

golden spectral horse bounding around

now filled with these hellhounds Jason

and I like to think they're having fun

exactly um is there anything else that

you wanted to do before leaving the

scene uh you know based on what you told

me I feel pretty good I feel pretty uh

what's the word I feel like this is the

right choice did you take the chicken no

he dropped out job did shut up chicken

do it consider it my farewell gift

oh really our gift for you you could

take it yeah you can keep it no no I

couldn't

gray bike you hungry come on Trix was so

proud of that chicken but she would

never get to go away anyways yeah I'm

pretty much just gonna find the closest

dark crevice I can and then hopefully no

one will follow me okay uh and so with

the with cozen gone DF as you do you

want there are no guards in here good

you can see great what do you want to do

I'm going to take the flask and uncork

it here okay I get ready to die

dwarf sorry I'm not here you didn't hear

that

a gigantic plume of fire spills out in

front of you

disgorging a creature so enormous

well the ceiling hair is about thirty

feet tall this creature is normally

about 50 feet tall multimode best way

bigger than I thought it was and when it

comes out it sort of spreads throughout

the chamber um alright and when that

happens you immediately burst into

flames and soon does everyone in the

room that's bigger than I thought it was

oh there are there are about two dozen

or so screams of anguish and then you

see the sort of all of these doors and

films turn into blackened sky

almost there cells then sort of melt

like slag and fall down around them and

all the walls around you go black oh hey

that's well we'll stop for tonight it's

friendly to you at least but I opened

the doors right

uh yeah door you did open the doors the

cork the doors all melted

so yes dead was that your plan Jared it

was cool your plan was to melt the doors

but instead you you melted them yeah you

melted their hearts literally oh okay

thought I didn't think as is that large

I thought maybe be like more like what

sighs and get like a fly across the

rooms I quickly melt all the things I

thought that's gonna be a little more

country no that was that over ended this

session with the triumph all right

so yes there is a big rush of flames out

in all directions from this room and

we'll pick up next week with episode 50
