hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action

yay we're not dead yeah no okay

let's see let's just jump right in

alright you guys are all still alive and

thank goodness I challenged a god it was

a bad idea yeah there was this burnt

simple of endar the night serpent in the

middle of the jungle and it seemed to be

swallowing a symbol of the Sun and there

was a dead dinosaur on the Sun and strix

went up to it and she got so close that

monkeys left out at her face and sent

her but she had sleep deprived herself

as well so she was pretty much out of it

for most of last session and wamba

returned briefly and was disposed of no

no and yes Strix fell asleep and her

nightmares seemed to have spawned an

effigy of dendera the night serpent that

tried to eat evylyn but evylyn fought it

off and drawing it away from her friends

while d/f picked her up and bore her

into the jungle so that she could not be

eaten as well and eventually Strix woke

up and the the dendara

spectral form disappeared which was good

because it could have done some serious

damage and in the wake of this you guys

have now marched on moved on I'm going

to advance the timeline another three

days which means

palton Strix and DF each lose one hit

point from the death curse that is

gnawing away at them physically one each

yeah it would have been a lot worse of

course except you've got two magic

rings that you are sharing between the

three of you to mitigate this life

draining effect we should establish who

is currently wearing the Rings for the

day yes

so I am going to say that it is Strix

and paltin so you guys got that yeah the

plus one the armor class and saving

throws so that's right it's important so

I'm guessing that Strix might still not

be sleeping that's entirely up to you

eventually there will come a point where

it will be so sleep deprived that

essentially she's moving at half speed

and is like a disadvantage on everything

we should maybe roleplay a little bit

that I think like evylyn and DF have

been trying everything they can to get

her yeah okay that's something that

would just be like oh alright yeah it's

it's very noticeable well I don't want

the mercy killers to come back so she's

just mad and upset

I don't know how what we have time for

that way yeah yep before she just falls

flat on her face and doesn't get up in

17 hours right like evylyn just tries to

reason with her a ton like you need you

need sleep you need to like you can't

cast any smells your gonna cast the

wrong spells and we need your spells and

she just keeps babbling and babbling and

babbling about how she needs to go to

sleep okay yeah I mean if she convinces

Strix that she's going to hurt her

friends by being too sleepy like she'll

definitely I do think walk away and just

try to sleep in a corner someplace sad

she's right Strix like if you're not

yourself

we need you like the best it's fine just

gonna lay on the ground yeah no no

now faking this time after sleep this is

like when we've all been it down for the

night and we've noticed that Strix is

like not slept at all and she's

pretending to sleep but we both figured

out that she knows that she's not

sleeping and so I imagine that we're

kind of like evens trying to do

everything she can to make her

comfortable like she gets a special

little fluffy something I was gonna say

blanket but we definitely don't have

fluffy blankets but she is so but if

she's up against warm waffles like using

her lay down next to her and then even

kind of kneels down and she's kind of

like holding her little hand and

strict's you're totally delirious oh

look what you see Simon and like a mouth

appears on him that's all getting very

sleepy yeah see that's that's all the

sign that we need DL even like sit down

next to her and be like I'm staying

right here and making sure you're

getting sleep tonight nothing's

nothing's coming for you nothing's going

to touch you yeah she does go to sleep

yeah because you convinced her that if

she is going to hurt her party she's

going to go to sleep but she's still

very worried and there's a bunch of

chalk markings on the ground but like

we'll do nothing

once even sees that she fell asleep she

like looks happily and she kind of

smiles at the earth like knowingly and

leaves Strix kind of an onion in his

watch and he's deaath you've got the map

that you picked up from Camp vengeance

yes you're swinging kind of on a

southwesterly course you're now at the

base of these giant plateaus that rise

up above the jungle and they have jungle

foliage on top of them but they're

thousands of feet high the closest one

it looks to be at least 1,800 2,000 feet

tall and just sheer cliffs with sort of

heaps of boulders as large as ships

around the base of it

as you were sort of scoping out the area

and charting your path for the next day

you see that there is a narrow path cut

into the cliff face that seems to climb

all the way to the top of this plateau

you lose sight of it once in a while it

seems to sort of corkscrew around the

plateau but you do see that it's there

that's not the direction you want to go

to get to or illunga but you do note it

that it does get and based on your map

that probably leads up to the village of

Bala oh that was marked on your map as a

site as a as a some sort of settlement

between camp vengeance and or illunga

yeah we had discussed kind of making a

pit stop there you had entertained the

thought yes yeah and come the morning as

Strix wakes up and her eyes are much

less bloodshot than they have been the

past several days and she sort of gets

back into her normal routine you can

bring this up to the rest of the party

okay

you've probably spent the night in the

waffle hut because that's just the

safest and it sort of keeps the insects

from devouring you or so yeah

I've also been keeping my like her

cartographers cape this whole time now

I'm like trying to fulfill that I'll one

dudes request yes yeah passage okay yeah

I'll bring up to the others that we're

pretty much right nearby where we could

take that path way up towards mamala if

we want to stop there and get anything

that we could possibly need or if you

want to see ourselves in some time we

keep it going going straight to or

illunga I'm just happy to spend time

with all of you so I would love to take

the long way around but also you seem to

be getting worse by the day so let's

just go however we can get there fastest

yeah maybe we can use it on the way back

I mean I'm feeling worse worse every day

and I'm about the rest of you

just like a black raised it over your

shoulder you can all make perception

checks okay

hey 24 good anybody beat at 24 almost

6x6 I got a three oh wow okay I should

roll for dragon bait he also rolled a

three and okay TF as you're looking

around you can see something you haven't

seen before in the nature of this place

you've seen some dinosaurs and giant

spiders and other things crawling

through the jungle but you've never seen

flying monkeys before now well you see a

pack of flying monkeys flapping overhead

going up toward the top of the plateau

and it looks like they're carrying what

looked like to be baskets do these

monkeys look similar to the zombie ones

that attacked us to previous days

no they you can't really see them up

close but they're much sort of smaller

and fluffier they look like if I can get

close off the camera so you can see it

nailed it there we go

all right I can kind of make it up I

can't move I'm actually I'm locked in by

two cords this is ridiculous okay I

could kind of see it on streem I think

sorry it is it's a it looks like a a

little fuzzy monkeys with big feathery

wings all right and they're carrying

little baskets which direction do they

come from they seem to be coming up from

the jungle okay I think I hate y'all

well everyone breakfast

what breakfast I don't know whatever

nasty rations we have

yeah Risa are we still good on food

stores for the next while so I know I

got grabbed a lot of that before we left

weapons are good

okay great and you stock up it can't

vinyasa to ever not too bad on supplies

we may not need ma'am Bala right now

might be better I'm just trying to get

to where we need to go as fast as

possible so we can get this over with

and because I feel hardly compelled to

the place she wants you to go right yeah

that's the place right so if we deviated

that that I probably know that that

Gea's might cause an ill effect yeah

you'd be brain bang great yeah we don't

want that no all right we'll take the

direct path okay so I don't know what

else we could possibly stop for that'd

be useful excellent your journey

continues for another I want to say six

days that we're going to sort of gloss

over montage style yes seems more and

more yep

so you meander through these giant which

might call it plateaus you do see over

the course of your many days of journey

not only dinosaurs in this neck of the

woods but also more of those Pteranodon

folk that had accompanied Wamba you

occasionally see them sailing high in

the skies overhead but you sort of duck

under the canopies of the jungles and

stay out of sight as best as possible

they must have a roost on top one of the

plateaus or something once you get past

the plateaus you don't see them much

around anymore you do come to a river

which on your map is marked the river

Taff and it flows out of the Mist cliff

mountains southward spilling out into a

bay far far to the south of or illunga

but you'll have to cross this river to

get to where you need to go and when you

get to this river you can see there is a

big

crashing waterfall farther up the river

you can see the mist coming off of it

and hear its roar and then the river

water itself looks to be a couple

hundred yards wide Wow there is a

nothing on that map indicating any kind

of possible bridge or other passageway

no well got finally across this river

I'm pretty sure I can use dimension door

to take one of us across at a time

well there's a lot of us I can't fly

anymore Eaglin oh well then you guys can

go together and I can fly together it'll

be real fun it's too far across for

dimension door the maximum range of

dimension door is 500 feet oh it's you

say this is hundreds of yards oh yeah

it's about you guessed about 650 700

feet oh and how is waffle since I'm

gonna get across then pass for American

Honda maybe you guys could fly up and

see if there it gets narrower down the

way or maybe there's a bridge to scout

it out okay I just try to get a scope of

what the rest of the river looks like

absolutely yes you can see that at one

point the river kind of plunges down

deeper into a gorge and you see what

appears to be a stone bridge that

crosses the gorge so we would need to

scale this like waterfall cliff face

down to get to that bridge no you just

have to basically make your way down the

side of the river that you're on

eventually that side is going to get

higher and higher up away from the river

as you're sort of moving along with the

gorge and then the bridge you'll just

come to the end of it and is it really

far like do I see it as a detriment to

our ability to get anywhere fast or is

it a negligible amount it's you think

it's about a half hour diversion okay

but I fly down and tell them exactly

what I saw okay that sounds way better

than swimming considering last time yeah

that will probably be our fastest and

most expedient way across a little girl

and I scratch waffles you like cringes

don't you alright and you didn't get

terribly close to the bridge but you saw

it kind of had a faint arch to it and

had two big stone supports holding it up

that go all the way down to the base of

the gorge and then there was some sort

of shrine on the middle of it with a a

figure or statue on top of the shrine

and then there are smaller statues just

kind of on the edges of the bridge

following it along from one end to the

other I look out for the word yup and

dub we've all had some experience with

statues that we thought were harmless

that yeah these ones these ones look

from a distance to be kind of weathered

and some of them had fallen over and

toppled you also knows there's some sort

of statuary clinging to the underside of

the bridge underside yep can even do

like a fly around average I'm so losing

see what you can see do you want

perception yes please oh that's a wait

no that's a one pulse and starts playing

while you're like flying right can we

agree that usually the like logo of a

die is the 20 thanks acquisitions

incorporated yeah I actually get totally

distracted yes by a bird and I'm like

it's got the prettiest bird you follow a

colored bird for a while and I should

probably get back to my friends yeah

yeah okay I see anything at all like I

just noticed there are statues I guess

yes oh cool

there's a she's down there too alright

okay

so you make the diversion and then when

you all get to the end of the bridge you

can see what

evylyn could not which is that this

ancient ancient stone bridge looks like

it may have been built by dwarves

because the statues of the figures that

kind of line both sides of the bridge

are actual dwarves some of the statues

have been toppled others are worn by

time and weather so as to have lost many

of their fine features and in the middle

of the bridge is a raised stone dais

upon which sits a not a literal

representation of a man but sort of a

stylized representation of one of a sort

of portly bear bellied man sitting or

squatting on top of this dais facing in

your direction

the other thing you notice is that the

top of the tiles the stonework that

you'll walk on to cross this bridge has

maze-like labyrinthine patterns carved

into it you do think that they have some

reason largest conurbation that they

might be tied to the god of towel and

that the figure on the dais facing you

on the middle of the bridge may be a

representation of OOP towel and actually

given that he's got what looks like a

circular symbol carved into his forehead

that has a maze-like design you're

pretty sure it's a representation of him

and you can see that the figure figures

just sort of sitting there with his arms

crossed and in both he's got what looked

like sculptures of like feather dusters

and it's at this point where everybody

can see underneath the bridge walking

through the gorge and basically eating

plants is a brontosaurus cool but no

it's big enough that if worth to sort of

lift its head up it would almost but not

quite reach the bridge like a little one

to see if I can hit it yeah you can just

make an attack roll

that would be 17 yeah you do you hit it

doesn't seem to pay a whole lot of

attention strikes you're an expert

dinosaur racer is not a fast one good

yeah maybe we can all ride it through

the jungle will go even faster and then

it can be our racing dinosaur in Strix

can race it and pause and complainers

concerts and we can live here and chill

and be happy forever together and I'm

marked down on my map brontosaurus here

don't worry

evylyn we'll come back for it let's go

those look like anything I could

fabricate around me but I was holding

that you can fabricate oh yeah like like

me cuz I'm convinced that we need to

copy every statue we find it she wants

to cosplay a zoo - well first of all you

have to find some big feathers yeah I

won't copy but I think we need to follow

the maze on the bridge and the point of

the maze okay okay so you kind of stay

on the sort of the maze like parts of

the bridge how are you gonna do that

with waffles okay you shrink her down

and then

I get the alibi already yeah yes it's

 she's even shrunk down she's kind

of big and awkward because you're super

strong you know you carry like a real

big toddler more like one of those big

giant teddy bears from the air yeah yeah

yeah exactly

okay so you make your way across you

past the Statue of OBL whose eyes in an

odd way although it's either purely

optical illusion do seem to follow you

as you go past and you make your way

past you cross the bridge without

incident and carry on great yeah are you

sure we don't want to but I could just

ask it brought a source if it wants to

come along or if we could ride it hi

evylyn you know what I really want to

but I'm looking at the time you just we

got a schedule to do okay you're right

I'm sorry okay

I'm sorry it was are insensitive me to

take time you I know you're very ill

let's go it also it also looks like the

dinosaur is having the time of its life

eating that tree dad do you want to

interrupt it no you're right

alright I say is I'm like turning evil

in away and like pushing her

evylyn does not cast speak with animals

but approximates what she thinks it

sounded like when she spoke to the

dinosaurs last time and says have a nice

day okay alright and so in the we're

gonna jump ahead a few days again each

of you will each of the three of you

will lose another hit point as you trade

rings but again when you finally reach

what you believe to be the outskirts of

or illunga paltin and Strix have the

wings again are they they're losing hit

points from their maximum is going down

yeah so my max hang is much lower yeah I

do not like this oh you don't like it

yeah if you were losing hit points I'm

pretty sure you would last yea over

twice as long as me I would love to give

you some of my hit points you already

have evylyn as we trade the Rings

divorce yep all right

you realize that you have entered or

illunga or you may have been walking

through or along it didn't even know it

but suddenly ruins start to spring up

out of the ground around you as you come

to a little Ridge and you look down

there is this valley that unfolds before

you in the heart of which is a massive

brick and stone ziggurat and growing all

around it and the smaller ruins that

surround it is our flowers the entire

valley is like a haven for for these

absolutely beautiful dazzling array of

flowers a lot of them seem to be of a

particular kind some sort of bluish

flower but there's also yellows oranges

pinks reds and whites in the mix it is

so visually dala something that at first

you don't even pick up the power of the

the scent that just comes off of this

valley a scent of myriad flowers sails

you yep and exactly except for evil and

of course who can't smell yeah or

flowers that's right you can't smell

strikes so I mean honestly I'm going to

try to ask dragon bait if he's able to

convey if he knows anything about these

flowers or if he can at least kind of

give us ideas these are good or bad I'd

hand him a piece of parchment and a

shock he smells like ham and kind of

shrugs his shoulders well alright so I

think we should generally avoid possibly

wild vegetation cuz who knows

jomi to set it on fire maybe not yeah it

seems or along

is entirely vegetation we could go take

a closer look and just not touch up if

you want me and Paulson can fly over

would that be pretty paulson you want go

look at flowers with me Alton's gonna

hop on his mandolin strum a few notes

and then take off on his mandolin and

you and thinks this is super cool okay

the two of you go flying over the ruins

of the city and you can see that the

flowers appear to be just innocuous

plants and there's nothing that suggests

that they're menacing or part of some

menacing force the city was big in its

day you think it was roughly laid out in

a circle and maybe even had walls around

the outside of it but those walls have

tumbled down and all the buildings had

been kind of swallowed up by the earth

and the foliage except of course for the

towering ziggurat all right but we're

really enjoying them together four

levels boom boom boom boom and they get

smaller as of course as they go up to my

understanding of based on what everyone

has told me as we got here is or illunga

itself this ziggurat is this cigarette

just kind of part or along it seems to

be at the center of the city okay this

is probably probably the most important

and it's the only structure that

survived

yeah that's nice though okay well now

evylyn and palton as you approach the

ziggurat itself just how close do you

want to get to it distance I think even

follows Paul Tinsley it so ever he goes

so okay so paulten seems to keep a safe

respectful distance from it you guys can

make perception checks to see if you

notice anything else okay okay

11:00 okay you do not

all good yeah yep all right I guess we

go rejoin the party eventually right yep

it's it just seems to be this sort of

lost very scenic picturesque location

quiet

you don't really other than some birds

and little critters around there's

nothing here to indicate that it's lived

in all right well I finish up my map

mm-hmm two or illunga for the dude back

in port Indians are yes so there's that

but there's probably treasure in there I

bet yeah I bet there's specifically two

shredders in there mm-hmm

or maybe around it's well yeah the one

detail that you do note is obvious on

the cigarette is that there are stairs

basically on the side that you're

looking at going at level by level well

it seems inviting enough so everyone

keep a safe distance from each other

from each other why I don't know

explosions who knows it's actually way

better if you stay close to me oh you're

right you know for the blesser it's just

it's really close just like okay here we

go

even really likes that she's she just

doesn't want to die even does that thing

where you get really excited like what a

dog sits on your lap or something and

you don't have moves so that it doesn't

like get spooked and leave you so she's

like as soon as she just moves away but

I want to try to um at least like stay

alert as we're doing this like maybe

have like spell like you're ready just

holding my staff gonna catch things on

fire as soon as I see anything moving

all right everyone be careful as we go

up the stairs and if you see anything

that looks like our wise Guardian let me

know okay when you get to that look like

a wise Guardian to media

when you get to the base of the ziggurat

you can see that the steps from the

ground to the next level are about 50

feet long and rise 30 feet and they're

covered with a tangle of roots vines and

creepers they're not thick enough that

you couldn't try to climb the stairs

however okay

but as you begin to make your way up the

stairs the vines and creepers

inexplicably become thicker and more

grasping and you find it harder and

harder the higher you get up it becomes

more and more difficult to pull your

feet up through these things like it's

just becoming thicker I feel like kind

of you don't it's weird you don't see

them coiling around you like they're

alive it's like they just seem to get

thicker and thicker somehow yeah I

imagine I'm kind of floating above them

do they are they reaching out for me or

do I not notice that's a very good

question as you float above them you

find yourself unable to proceed Oh lose

all forward ability to move strikes okay

what's happening stop and she's like

kind of pulling her little feet like

they're slowly grab onto her feet like I

think you're stopped yeah she's kind of

stuck in the air can I see I mean I

guess I ain't doing our contract maybe

see you see if what magics going on

around here

do you sense anything hmm I

I'll do I'll do mine that's a lot I play

24 yeah you think that there's a

powerful magical mojo around this

ziggurat all right I tried I just I just

go stop don't move everyone get back

there's a lot of magic okay you go back

down to the ground cannot imagine can i

you get back down to the ground you can

move away just fine okay so we can move

away just not forward correct okay I try

following them with my feet on the

stairs okay in which case you are able

to proceed up the staircase I hate

walking and as you do is anybody

following able at this point going back

up oh yeah I'll follow back up but I

will start poking around in the in the

in the vines it's like trying to see if

there's like a statue or any kind of

signal or anything I can find yeah you

know sorry can I do like my divine sense

to see if I sense any great evil sure no

but your divine sense isn't just limited

to evil right right it's it's Celestials

fiends and something-or-other Undead yes

I'm pretty sure that it's those three

things

yes

yeah so it's either strong evil or

powerful good I know the location of any

celestial fiend or Undead within sixty

feet that is not behind total cover all

right you sense none of those things

think it must be fine Strix like looks

at her horns and she's just like weird

yeah and you continue to make your way

up and again things become even more

entangled and Strix as you stick your

staff and tap it things and looking for

sigils and signs or statues or anything

you don't find anything but you do see

that the the ground cover seems to just

get thicker and thicker and thicker

around you until finally evil and you

realize you've gotten up high enough now

kind of leading the way that you take

one slashing damage oh no how do I feel

that how does that manifest it just

tears through your construct body like

like wow yeah like a you don't feel it

you just see damage done to you oh why

why is it hurting me it's not a just

something or someone or a towel I think

maybe doesn't want us to be here or

something is there a different way we're

supposed to we can walk around the

ziggurat let's just walk around it yeah

this dear the stairs don't go all the

way around the ziggurat there's sort of

a finite width okay one side so thinking

like the Mayan temples where it's like

the stairs go up okay yep yeah mm-hmm

well I can't fly up

I mean maybe we're just supposed to like

prove our desire to go up like maybe I

just have to take the damage you guys

can't but I can

well you can't just leave without us

well not leaving without you I'd just go

check it out and bring back whatever you

need I guess

trying to think if there's anything I

could do that would help I can set them

on fire but I don't think we should cut

anything or somehow disturb whatever is

happening here all right or we're fine

so like that totally applies to this do

it or don't I don't know I'm not the

boss of you I just think fire would be

fun right now well I can keep us healthy

if we all want to keep going I have

plenty of ways to make sure everyone

stays healthy for a while well try it

try to keep going up people in this wall

can we get generally do you have like

how many more stairs we have to get up

or how much longer if they go you've

gone you climb about ten feet before

evylyn started to take damage so like

barely any at all yeah the steps are 50

feet long I'm just trying like impulse

and says that like kind of a gimme Oh

knows I'll be at the bottom let's try a

little fireball just go you zap some of

the vine and stuff and then you see them

quickly sort of grow and fill in all

right yeah we're not gonna cut our way

through this is not gonna work Alton I'm

sorry to disappoint you sorry even tries

um hello powerful magic we just wanna

come visit so maybe please don't hurt us

be quiet

that's the how it works ever gonna make

perception checks to see if you see or

hear anything after evil ins - because I

was yelling at evil in - be quiet

14:19 alright palton you see next to you

a little just a little ways off from you

a tiny little figure about a foot tall

spindly thin black except for a mask it

wears on its face that's white and kind

of looks vaguely like a triceratops and

you can see it's holding in one hand a

purple orchid and an orange orchid in

the other hand and when it sees you it

sniffs the orchids and then bounds up

the stairs and it doesn't seem to be at

all inhibited by the vines and you're

like come back the rest of you is he

looking grown again I'm not going

anywhere Politan don't worry no Darren

guys there's a little there was a little

dude and he had some flowers and then he

ran off and I want to know what he

smelled also he didn't have a problem

with the vines so that also seems useful

Why What the flowers are those the key I

don't know you just see strikes runoff

into the flowers and just start like

grabbing the ground she comes back with

both colors it just like holds them out

to everyone okay so she hands you off a

bunch of purple orchids and orange

orchids with a lot of dirt on them with

hanging roots and things yeah I feel

like an idiot

no I'm serious he smelled one I'm sorry

it smelled one I don't want to assume

then it smelled the other and then it

was just like peace which one did it

smell first

the purple one thank God no one of the

time one at a time just in case Oh wash

kills us there's something okay do you

think it matters if I actually can't

smell it

mm-hmm that's a good question you blood

well after we try we'll cross that

bridge when we get there I'll smell the

purple one now smell the orange one

spicy still holding on to them okay now

go guy go

all right you bound up the stairs and

you get to the top where there's like a

little landing before the next set of

stairs go up to the next tier but you're

now standing right at the top oh my god

guys you know it was the actual creepers

and things kind of got out of your way

as you were padding your way up the

steps be like the flowers smell

all right strings don't smell one then

smell the other one yeah maybe take a

little bite okay you're able to get all

the way to the top pollen you're so

observant you did amazing yeah I'm gonna

do the same now okay you able to bound

up to the top I hope I see you guys

again

it's tricks did you give Simon any

flowers oh yeah

yeah he will kind of stick his flower

into his nose and make another flower on

doors you can't actually smell either

but after doing that he runs up the

stairs and get something okay I'll see

Evelyn if Simon can do it sweet make

waffles melon yeah even tries to help

waffles is waffles still small no he

would've been yeah all right so she

takes waffles little pond she puts a

little flour and she like holds that up

so awful snows and then she takes her

other little paw and does the same thing

she's like that's that smell good girl

no go get sticks at first at first after

she's forced to sniff these stupid

flowers he kind of drops the flowers and

kind of lumbers up towards Jason gets

rebuffed and caught in the she gets

tangled up in the vines and starts to

how old put some flowers behind her ears

okay can I can I like wind them through

her feathers somehow and like put them

in flower crowns yeah

yeah so you tuck the feathers into her

and then is able she's able to get up to

the girl the dragon mate does the same

thing just stomps up there and then

evylyn as soon as everybody else has

gotten up there even tries the same

thing yeah you don't smell anything but

you have the flowers you head up and no

problem you get to the top sweet baby we

just need the flowers maybe we didn't

actually need to smell yeah but it was

fun wasn't it

they're so nice now the steps to the

next level are about 33 feet long and

they rise about 20 feet total and the

stone here is really kind of beginning

to crumble with age and decay but

there's no creepers or anything growing

on them mmm all right everyone be on the

lookout

who knows what something's gonna pop on

the stairs or something to grow around

us or something

I'm sure it'll be fine first to see what

bad things are going to happen when you

walk up these stairs I agree

okay get going even start walking

evylyn after the first few steps the

stone seems to crumble into gravel under

your feet and you slide back down uh I

mean I assume I know the answer but she

gives it a good try anyway with the

flying boots yeah you are rebuffed

you're unable to proceed and off the

steps ah shucks alright anyone see any

flowers up here paulten do you see the

little little thing

Walton okay yeah they speak to you

Paulson because you lick the ground 17

yeah you see a little spindly tiny one

foot tall black figure it's white mask

that looks sort of like a chameleons

head and you can see it is carrying an

orange and a purple orchid in one hand

and a red orchid in the other okay and

it sniffs the two then it sniffs the red

one and then it runs up the steps with

ease

and Paul's only one seeing this all

right guys no it worked the first time

it's it's fine okay so the two in the

one hand and then the red and the other

and then he smelled the two it smelled

the two and it smelled the red and then

it made its way up I don't make the

rules Kay well there's a red how many

colors the flowers were out there

there's like purple orange red blue pink

white yellow do we have red you know or

the executioner's hood okay it goes down

and I imagine like yeah it's only take

their colors that we need I like that

she didn't hear that she just yeah very

picky so she's like fluttering over

these flowerbeds trying to find the most

beautiful ones yeah it takes even three

time to break out your sandwiches she's

like this little golden be flitting

around here she has these kind of

metallic construct hands I like to

imagine that she's kind of like snipping

the flowers like you know sir Knight

nice and neat and she'll kind of like to

pick one and then she'll look at it and

be like and like took a little leap off

of it and then she remembers again that

her friends are slowly wasting away by

curse okay you come back with a hood

stuffed with all kinds of colorful

flowers of every type that you could

find I held them out to paltin all right

which one is it was purple

in orange it's for the first right yeah

yeah the second wall was red it smelled

the two first and then the one second

and then he made his way but even make

sure everyone has those and she makes a

new flower crown for all right same

thing everyone you have to sniffing

sniff those flowers that I'm going up

the stairs to the two in the red just

hold them very stiffly just like all

right yes when you follow up Alton's

plan you're able to get up the stairs to

the top without incident Wow

alright what was in those oh my god it's

working tell us what you see now when

you get to the next tier you can see

that there is a set of steps that are 20

feet long and rise twelve feet and you

didn't see this before palton when you

were you know keeping your respectful

distance from the ziggurat

but while the stairs are in excellent

condition they're covered with swarms of

poisonous snakes Vipers crawling all

over them

oh good do you see the little person

just snakes like flowers you don't see

the little person okay make a perception

check sixteen oh there he is he looks up

at you black spindly creature white mask

looking like a mongooses face you can

see that he has got a red or sorry an

orange a purple and a red orchid in one

hand and in the other he's got a yellow

orchid okay

and with that yellow orchid he goes over

and

beats one of the snakes even the orchid

and it makes the snake angry and then he

takes the other orchids and gently

strokes them over the snake to calm it

and then he lies down next to the snake

and the snake crawls through is Mongoose

mask disappears down his throat and then

he gets up and he throws the flowers

away and runs up the stairs and gets to

the tippy-top alright so check it out so

this one's a little bit of a longer

process whoever's going first I need you

to listen to me and just do it as I tell

you how to well because I need to like

call it out to you

I need a mr. right okay cool that works

that's a great idea so first off we need

yellow ones okay bolo out yeah cool so

have the first three we had in the one

hand and then the yellow in the other

alright walk over the snake okay

now hi snake all right I'm gonna need

you with the yellow one I need you to

beat its ass just where's the snake's

ass when you do that evil into the snake

rears up in his is at you threatening Li

okay now take the other three and like

give it some some loving caresses and

calm it down do it okay nice snaky

the other organs and it does seem to

calm down

I lead over this tricks he's making this

up okay okay now without reading too

much into the next part just lay down

next to it Paul did sometimes sometimes

you make up things as jokes and they're

real funny just go ahead okay look it's

like you see the snake is starting to

slither over toward your head evylyn

it's fine you can't smell it and just

just let it do easy it's in the time

that you would feel this but you can't

but you can see it when you're

cross-eyed stare its tongue comes over

and basically tickles your lips we're

making friends with it it's fine dad

we're making friends I don't wait was

there another step you should open your

mouth just just go ahead it tastes like

chicken but don't actually eat it okay

it just wants to take a little rolls in

through your mouth it goes you see it

disappear down into Evelyn's mouth and

throat I mean once it's in you you can

you can sort of feel it crawl down

inside of you and then it's just sort of

gone inside of you stretch just like

walk stuff it just takes the yellow

flowers and the other ones like oh this

is this is there everyday for me to

start skating

alright it gets pissed off at you just

like lays down just like alright here we

go alright it comes over to your mouth

and she just like kind of enjoys it just

ooze it like sucks the tail into like

all right let's get up the thing

yeah that's she's not just want this day

yes Strix goes up the stairs no problem

look over at paltin afters like watching

Strix do it too just okay well Simon

first let's make sure he gets up fine

like men sigh man do you want to go to

bed without dinner fine he will take the

flowers and do the ritual whack whack

whack caress caress caress lie down

snake goes in him he walks up alright

here we go

then he's up top basically doing this I

I try to help waffles do this before I

go up but I try to make it like a treat

really hard for waffles can't I do that

like do you have all of it for and then

be like sneak treat when you try when

you essentially beats listening it and

it comes over to you not waffles crap

waffles didn't wait for us right it's

not like anything can hurt her here can

I like we've taught her some tricks

right we've taught her how to fight

things so she at least knows how to

whack something so if I make her a

little like bracelet out of the flowers

and I'm like get it get the sake and she

whacks it okay right okay and then and

then we probably because she's so big we

probably had to teach her gentle Jen's

just hold her paw

you know alright okay the snake will

calm down and then like down waffles

down down the snake will crawl over to

her mouth and she just needs it then she

bounds up yeah okay all right here we go

and first they take out all right okay

well this is going on by the way dragon

bait smells like sadness he starting to

smell like roses actually I also smell

like sadness okay you watch as palton

does the ritual and has a snake crawl

into his mouth go all the way down

alright not gonna lose it he goes up I

hate this immediately throw up at the

top yeah

Oh comes the sandwich oh okay cuz you

and dragon bait now yeah this started

out as such a beautiful romantic night

oh boy I look over at a dead dragon baby

see if he makes uh I move it all uh he

just stands there and the look on his

face suggests you know I'm happy to wait

here yeah you guys feel like we're weird

he doesn't say anything I was like same

and I'll take my flowers and beat the

snake all right after you complete the

ritual and the snake crawls in you

you're able to bound up the steps I'm

very upset

like noticeably upset the entire time

just like like you know were you like

something like a piece of seaweed just

touch my foot that's like that's the

kind of like I'm seriously when you get

to the top ziggurat there's like the

snakes we're never there you don't see

any of them I'm really disappointed

mm-hmm

but here at the top of the shrine at the

top of the e-cigarette you all see

something that was not visible beyond or

outside of where you currently are

previously it looked like the ziggurats

that this was just the flat top of it

overgrown cracked and broken but there

is actually a structure a shrine on top

of the ziggurat that is not visible from

anywhere else but where you stand

oh you can see that the outside walls

are decorated with labyrinth symbols of

Uptown and Beyond an open doorway you

see what looks like at least from here

to be a barren dusty room throw up a

little more okay palton when you look in

that direction you can see a little man

he is carrying a orange and purple and

red and yellow or cash it we're still

doing this one hand carries a white one

in the other and run us into the shrine

there's more oh come on it's okay it's

less gross we don't have to eat anything

okay so it had all the ones we had

previously in one hand and then a white

in the other and then he just kind of

went in oh that's easy that's a lot to

put that something else into an orifice

if you want to I don't think it's

necessary I mean save that for later if

you see dragon bait hasn't come up he's

staying on the lower tier all right yes

that's probably fine yeah we should have

maybe we should have waffles show him we

just the dragon bait well I mean waffles

likes dragon be

I get along just fine all right

waffles go away don't wake the dragon

babe waffles will sheepishly make her

way back down the stairs the dragon baby

well do you see yeah give her some

snacks I'll give her some sneaky sneaks

okay you you take care of her dragon

bait he nods okay

we have light flowers yeah what about

Simon Simon coming

Simon takes pollens hand all right well

you know what palton you go first all

right let's go all right you got a white

flower in your hand and Simon's got a

white flower in his hand and the two of

you walk into the dusty chamber only

when you enter it is not a dusty chamber

it appears to be a a a brilliant

lived-in room with hanging lamps from

the ceiling incense burners filling the

room with exotic scents and curling

smoke you see cushions and reed mats

covering the floor pots of blooming

flowers lining the plaster walls and

singing birds flitting from plant to

plant flower to flower an immense snake

with iridescent scales rainbow in color

coils upon a heap of cushions at the far

end of the room you can see it is coiled

around a thing that looks like a hookah

that it is basically smoking and making

puffs in the air and one of those puffs

looks like a dragon another one looks

like a ship and another one looks like a

horse and carriage it's silly are we all

following called two nerds as only you

will all see this but I'm describing it

for the first person who entered the

room palton you see that its face is not

a Serpent's face but a human-like face a

woman of sorts she's got scales on her

features but it's basically a human face

her eyes

our pools of iridescent light and she

you see she's got a snake-like tongue

but otherwise her features a human but

this creature is large like the body of

the snake isn't going to stick around as

a man's torso and she must be 18 20 feet

long

although coiled up it's a little hard to

tell and her head is bigger than yours

and she says I a massage into Bozza what

do you seek in this ancient place speak

truly so that I can hear your heart and

then the rest of your friends sort of

pile in white orchids in one hand jerks

is like sneezing from allergies and yeah

you're there smoke hanging in the air

here and this iridescent serpentine

creature says you're a funky group yeah

funky I think that's the nicest thing

anyone's ever said to us funky and then

she sort of looks at you evil in and

says far-out oh my god

evylyn at first when she when she saw

this lady she has a little bit of snake

PTSD going on right now so at first she

was like huh

but then as soon as the lady said they

were funky and gave any kind of

compliment and tells her this she's

far-out she's like hey thanks oh and we

lost her I'm sure she disappears from

the room thrown back into some oblivion

space she was too pure yeah yeah the

Snickers is like out of sight

did do the rest of us hear this thing

introduce yourself and ask us that

question you're sure okay I guess DF

will step forward

all right and then he will say he'll say

we seek numerous things all for the

safety of ourselves and for she will

pass through the pipe and say take a hit

it's cool well she doesn't pass it to

you she basically just sort of gesture

Stewart yes Alden just yeah alright

she's back for one minute we are guests

alright so yeah I'm gonna let up I'm

gonna palton toke it up do that right

well Strix will join him she has nothing

looks like it's fun yeah okay so while

they're doing that yeah I'll say so we

seeked Obrist things plus things that

will guarantee the safety of ourselves

and the gear and we'll have the safety

though for the lives of hundreds maybe

thousands of people I am trying to find

the spell book of sure Mishka the

eyeglasses of mr. Fox whoever that

whatever that is

and finally we seek the soul monger and

how to destroy it oh yeah

I've been around a long time so of the

stars and I'm like the stars I can see

everything

whoa I see stars

dude star see us I don't think even can

get high but when she hears that she's

just as impressed by it and she says

what you want is you know mo man is well

isn't it's what it's in Oh mo the

Forbidden City I've been there you have

woman took me away oh she's a star

dinosaur racer remember yeah she says

people used to live there a long time

ago but the kingdom fell Gupta left them

and New Gods came but the gods they were

tricksters man they didn't believe

welcome was one of them named den dar

know night serpents no that's something

else but watch out for that one that one

lies trapped under the peaks of flame in

the underworld you ever heard of Raza

Niecy wait a sec

yes yes I've seen visions visions of

rosin easy and his followers bringing

denned are the Knights serpent back into

the world that would be the end of

everything English Dan dart will swallow

the Sun now that's never gonna happen

that doesn't sound stellar string starts

to like freak out like what what what do

you mean no don't worry no one can

swallow the Sun strikes no that attitude

dear fool of like take out a piece of

parchment and quickly sketch a triangle

like symbol and like show it to the -

that's not a bowl of rosin ICI he is not

a gravy dude he used to be human like

you you know but then he became a

serpentine creature one of the you

auntie how did you do that and why he

went through a dark ritual they say

after he was driven out of Mesirow and

raised his undead army to try to take

over the whole land he was thwarted of

course and went into hiding

went to omou and joined up at the you

auntie there and underwent one of their

rituals and became just like them

so you believe he currently resides in

elbow oh yes all omens point to oh man

the Fox we have to find the Fox

straights is like pulling your hair out

we need to find mr. Fox's spectacles

which are you know I don't know anything

about this mr. Fox and I haven't seen

him so if he's there he's somewhere

hidden very cleverly yeah but surely

there are places in Omo I can't see into

but I know that they're there extra

dimensional spaces man extra dimensional

that's real far out yeah we have some

experience with that he's a he's a she

says if you want to survive in Omo you

have to know what's there you have to

know what's waiting for you man the

auntie they have nests there they live

under the city now not in the city but

under it they're hiding

they are hiding and they're looking they

are looking for a crown that will open

up the gates to the underworld and let

their den darn the night serpent out ya

know so the monty are not so reasonable

nice people oh they are the evil of the

evil they are the evil lest

oh she remembered my name is she so cool

and she says but they have been tricked

they have been betrayed the one they

work with the one who they count on for

their protection he has betrayed their

leader he's betrayed them all he's gonna

betray everyone Rossi cares about are

the souls of the dead

their leader being rose me see the

auntie leader is Rosnay see but he's a

true them all but his time in this world

is limited it is finite it is coming to

an end

it sure is why do you say that is it cuz

we're gonna help cuz he's been cursed

just like oh where does Sarah rach come

into all this so she's like she's also

reaching over to like paulsen to take

the hookah thing yeah when you take the

hookah thing away from paula nice sort

of fights him for it and she says oh

yeah bonebag himself came down here and

killed the omens gods all nine of them

they weren't real gods of course they

were the trickster gods the ones who

fooled the omens into worshipping them

so they weren't powers they weren't

powerful they were they were powerful

but they weren't powers yeah they they

were yo-yos let me tell you a story

about these trickster gods yeah stories

of The Omen trickster gods died with the

only ones who worshipped them but I

gotta tell you these stories are burned

into my brain

long ago the god ooop tau hardened his

heart and vowed vowed to weep for the

people of omen no longer tiresome they

became to him so the rain it stopped in

the jungle with it and died

and death swept through the city one

morning a wise Sorbo you know what they

are they're like koala bears that live

in trees but they destroy magic with

their touch but a wise or beau emerged

from her hollow tree and spoke to the

dying omens to convince you of their

worth she decided to cook him a stew

made from all their good qualities

catching such virtues wouldn't be easy

so she asked a wily owl mirage do you

know what that is oh that's a horn bunny

are they mean - no they're far out

groovy man sweet she asked this wily al

mirage to help her and the AL mirage

snuck recklessness into the pot which

she saw as a virtue an OOP Taos spat out

the stew where he tasted it from that

day on Oba laka the zorbo and a jinn the

AL Mirage became terrible enemies that

noon a brave Gama dan do you know what

that is it's like Oh big cat with snakes

coming out of its shoulders it hopped

down from her rock she saw the evil in

the omens hearts and decided to Lance it

like a troublesome boil the gamma Dan

fashioned a holy spear but she left it

by the riverbank and a crafty groung do

you know what that is

yes we do know that oh yeah a crafty

groan stole it in her rage shag ambi the

commad on forgot all about the au moins

and chased Nang Nang the groung forever

across the sky when evening came

a wily ugly you know what that is oh

that's a big tall monstrous crane like a

bird with a big long beak and long

spindly legs a wily eppley stepped from

his reed hut he didn't night the old

ones but without them he'd have

no one to play his chicks on the ebony

sent a marsh frog to reason with OOP

towel but the Frog was angry and decided

to wrestle the God instead this amused

OOP Tao so he gave the Frog tentacles to

make it stronger when Kubas on the Frog

hemas returned to Papa's offal the ugly

he chased papa's offal into the swamp

with his new tentacles and they became

enemies thereafter that night a Sioux

monster you know what that is it's a

monkey who can scream into your brain

okay yes actually yes a su monster broke

into Taos Palace and stole a pail of

water for the omens when the gods came

running to find it the SU monster hid

the pail in the jacuzzis burrow do you

know what a jack is it's a

gigantic snake that lives in a tree and

can change its color to blend a million

and it can leap from a tree like an

arrow and stab you

Oh boob Tao asked the jungle animals

where his water was hidden and MOA the

jakku lea was too honest to lie when

WANGO the SU monster found out how MOA

had betrayed him he vowed to catch the

jakku Li and eat him up all the while

UNK the flail snail you know what that

is a big giant snail with an iridescent

shell and a five flail like appendages

growing from its head UNK lived deep

under the earth the noise of the other

animals fighting made her slither up to

the surface and when day dawned over her

shell the light blinded ooop tau and

made his eyes water and their life

returned to omou and the people built

shrines in honor of the animals who had

saved them these nine trickster gods

then a CEREC that bonebag bully shows up

and killed them all just murdered him

straight right in front of the people

who worshiped him and then threw their

bodies into a tomb that he had the omens

build under their City and after the

tomb was built and after the own ones

and their Minotaur has finished all

their work he killed them all and

trapped them inside the tomb

well some living some dead and then he

sealed it all up

gods and worshipers all bound in his one

dark place and that's where the evil and

ilona resides and that's where the crown

of the you want e are searching for

resides and that I fear is where your

mr. Fox resides inside this tomb there

gonna be a test on this no just take

another hit evylyn grabs it and tries to

take on herself

yeah does it have any effect no no just

kind of gate comes out her ears

yeah pretty much yeah so we're going for

this tomb and you said this tomb is

located beneath or below o move that's

right

is there a way how do we keep a little

boom you mean into the tomb yeah so

inside of it you have to find the nine

cubes of the trickster gods

they're like keys all right

the only find those a Sarah AK placed

them in the omens old shrines dedicated

to each of the gods

cool

where is it good if there are nine

tricks or gods so nine shrines if I want

to find those shrines they are scattered

all over the city man uh action dang but

you'll know him when you see him as I

never never tried to do this before yeah

recently in fact really how did that go

if they get annihilated you might say

that let's just say it remains to be

seen huh all right well can you help us

make a map of where all these shrines

are where we need to collect all these

cubes she says I got a better idea

you'll take us there yourself no I don't

need this place are you sure it's real

nice outside there's flowers no I can

see why and she says this is the

happening place man yeah yeah it's dope

and but she says if you want to cast off

who you were and be born again I can

give you knowledge that you didn't

previously possess I'm sorry what

exactly do you mean by that

she says you gotta shed your skin man

let go what you were and does it forward

no it's all good cool I like who you

guys are

I don't think I want you to be someone

else let him do it yeah let him do it

I don't think anyone should do I don't

mmm instead of that maybe if you're good

at rebirth type of stuff maybe you could

heal all of them from this death curse

that's happening I can't do that I know

not a Dodd you see and that's a major

mojo but any you hurt might be able to

help you with that I have an ally she

will look at your ally and she will she

will sort of gently caress your ally

with her tongue and the ally disappears

the crack at the crack in your ankle

which that nasty creeper had left just

sort of is stitched up perfectly you

can't see the wound anymore he was like

hey I have an ally the us agreed to this

that's right

well look there's plenty of ways to get

knotted she says she looks at you evil

and says I'm afraid you can't change

your skin because you don't have one

yeah thank you for that yes so like how

literal is this is the skin shedding

like is it like like like an academic

skin or like a spiritual skin or is it

like you know like this is godlike like

it's a real far-out head-trip man like

all your skin's just keep them don't do

that

that sounds pretty red if you can keep

us from dying

did she just offer to make you trip

balls kind of sounds like it but also I

think I'll just new body boat stuff I

know I like you guys the way you are

it's like would I be like a different

person entirely or would I just have

this newfound enlightened sense of

knowledge you would just have

enlightenment you'd be the same old

palton do I believe her

make ideas I'd check yeah

as always important yeah Oh 21 whoo

there is something that she's not

telling you but you don't think that

she's being insincere okay

she's being what is wheat what is this

knowledge that you're offering I mean I

I could learn that the sky is blue and

that wouldn't help me much you know she

says it is just an awareness it is like

a heightened senses it's opening up

yourself to the world around you the and

all of the secrets that are contained in

the vicinity it's cool like perception I

don't have any of that it let's do

it all right Paul I don't trust it yeah

we've all died a couple times it's like

you guys are all hi stop making

decisions while you're high I just you

know be careful just in case sure death

why you're gonna he usually doesn't he

was yeah all right no people and you and

I will be right here as soon as we see

something anything go wrong we're

getting him out of here yep nice when

she licked my alleys maybe yeah yeah

so palton she sort of brushes your neck

with her tongue and as she pulls back

you feel that some sort of magic has

been cast upon you and then there's sort

of like this itch II feeling on your

neck where she licked you and I don't

know looked as you start to kind of just

get it a little bit scratching you start

to peel away the skin and I thought we

weren't doing literally becomes it

becomes this sort of compulsion all of a

sudden like this like a scab you just

can't leave it half picked so the rest

of youse just start to seep Alton

sealing off his face and kind of peeling

off his ears and his hair this is very

dramatic for ya you see basically there

is a nother paltin underneath what

appears to be this quickly drying and

cracking skin that surrounds him it's

like suddenly the the skin around paltin

is just all becoming cracked and dry and

there's another paltin right underneath

that's peeling himself out from this is

just like a snake's getting is shedding

his skin he just sort of takes it all

off his head and then starts to sort of

bundle it down his body and push the the

old palton off of him until he basically

steps out of his own skin Talton looks

great scientists hate him I thought I

couldn't get high are you seeing this

I'll see you this and then palton as you

come out of this you also feel that you

have sort of some powerful mojo or magic

cast upon you and all right dudu and you

now have the blessing of wound closure

and what that means is and this is

actually very very handy for you while

you have this blessing you stabilize

whenever you are dying at the start of

your turn so if you drop to zero points

you you stabilize automatically whoa

cool yeah that's crazy

how long does this

last I know yeah she tells you that it

will last until the next new moon which

is about 30 days away you made it so he

can't die wait so like I has any of this

been revealed to everyone no this is

just something you know okay so as soon

as I know this like right as I step I'm

like all right guys

new mission we can auto destroy the moon

I need this forever I'm not I'm not I'm

not high I swear this makes total sense

in my head but I'm feeling great him

know she unbreak me did you see me walk

out of me it was sick it was gross

it was great all right and then she

proceeds to eat palton skin except

except the parts that except the parts

that's tricks tore off and stuff she

says this is powerful magic man I got a

replenish don't Jesus as far out though

do you do you feel okay I feel like if I

were to almost die I wouldn't ah do you

feel like you know more than you ever

did before

I mean well technically yeah but I feel

like that applies to any time you learn

yep

oh the other thing that coming out of

the skin did is it shed off any scars

that you have so like the the wound that

you had on your neck from the

decapitation is just sort of gone with

the old skin so well this is like a

weird shiny new potion yeah I mean the

death Kurt the death curse will is still

taking hold and will weaken him as

normal but like guys don't worry I'm

still

I just look great yes you live a pretty

corpse yeah so you could like jump off

the top of this thing and then like just

be okay maybe don't she says that my

eyes just light up like look at the

snake I'm like good eye she says you're

just you man that's true you right you

right I shouldn't I could you know what

save it we'll save that you keep that in

mind we'll put a pin in it you never

know we'll save it

yeah the tomb sounds really bad I was

hoping that that was gonna be something

we could take a Miss on but you know she

says like we're taking a Miss if you

wait long enough maybe the cubes will be

found for you

by who yeah we don't really have that

luxury says other forces being what they

are

well should we be worried then that the

cubes aren't even in the shrines that's

at least in our time you'd even know

which cubes are left are you even a

snake person we've so many questions so

many questions

also as palton wearing clothes yes

amazing yeah okay yeah actually be

funnier if he wasn't wouldn't it yeah

mm-hmm so he should be naked yeah he's

you changed your mind

I totally wreck on that yes I'm wearing

the outfit he puts it he puts his

clothes back on after the skin is all

pulled out of it you know you don't have

to do that in an ideal world it's

falling out start collecting them from

the ground as she says that's a strange

you have no snake or person I don't know

all right well so we're supposed to find

these cubes but they might not be in the

place where we think they are and

someone else might have them and that

someone else might take care of this

thing for us but they might not so what

do we do now you said that there are

nine shrines and there's all over and

you

we couldn't help perhaps to have you B

point away or where we could find one of

these shrines you don't need me you got

your friend paltin here I I just saw him

crawl out of himself

it was wild man I mean he seems okay

actually so if you want to do it to

death maybe you should uh no that's okay

yeah

not all scars can heal she says oh do

you feel like you know yeah do you sense

anything do I sense anything no you

pretty much the same old same old as far

as you're concerned and she says oh he

won't feel anything here cuz we're not

even in the world oh man

when you get back her eyes will be

revealed the sky will open up and the

heavens will speak to you in a song or

whatever it's all razzamatazz okay thank

you Steve you can't come back have I

answered all your questions

oh no I like this place baby

you seem smarter says they are not of

this world or I wouldn't know them well

do you know who they are

anything anything why do you know

someone that looks like me to committed

a crime maybe a multiverse related crime

she says I know if someone who looks

like you but she hasn't committed any

crimes not yet no wait what what what

are you talking about who looks like her

she says all will be made clear when you

meet yourself what what is that

walk fam I'm sorry

time travel I didn't do that how about

this

a Sarah Rach is there a way to destroy

him he's a letch his phylactery is

somewhere who knows where intergalactic

space who knows destroy him now you can

annoy him you can make him angry you can

destroy his body and take his stuff but

you'll always come back until you find

its phylactery but it's not on this

world or I would know it the factory is

not on this world I talked about here or

like right outside that door

world on your world on this world it

doesn't where else

jiminee like helpful hints for finding

black black trees that's exactly how

easily braun says it she says destroying

him is a that's a tall order I wouldn't

recommend it better to look for the

cubes says destroy so longer otherwise

he'll bring that dead thing back to life

and then that will be the end of life as

we know it well here and meanwhile the

mercy killer who's gonna keep going

after me and whatever other plane we're

on and what I rather be

straik says you need to be cool you

chill out right that's right you gotta

chill out as I said I see what the stars

see there are no stars where you come

from girl I can't see into your pasture

where you came from but I know what

happens in the world right there are no

stars have you seen people that look

like the rest of us or just like her

just like her and him and him and looks

at Diaz and paltin they were made from

your hair they were made from from their

own hair unreal she's hers sorry to lay

it on you but that's the way it is

fearful symmetry man they're here in

this world yeah it's terrible

you'll meet them soon enough where where

we'll meet them how I'll need to come

over here and die our skin blue no we're

not the evil us she just starts like

ripping chunks of her hair I don't like

here stop did did she answer what I

asked where and how we would find them

she says that she doesn't know certain

things in the future are malleable all

she knows is what exists are they doing

evil things

it's due this time to the mercy killer

ah I don't know anything about mercy

killers so that's a whole other problem

Strix you didn't even do anything wrong

see you solve big misunderstanding it's

the other Strix it's that great news oh

I know it's all I don't know he starts

freaking out just like wait wait

what if we're the fake one fake ones how

do you know I don't think is what a

perfect excuse to get best-protected oh

soshim Abaza says instead of worrying

about killing us Arirang maybe you

should focus your energy on Raza Niecy I

remember him from his first uprising and

I urge you to kill him both as a

punishment for his past atrocities and

to prevent any possibility of a

recurrence all right thank you for the

yeah we'll do that in between being

killed by our doppelgangers and extra

dimensionals threats and mercy killers

and to rubble families and a bunch of

other things that are really terrible

thanks for nothing just to make sure I

got just wish I got that right Roz Niecy

was at home oh yes he he waged war on

cult with an undead army then was

defeated retreated to omou became a you

Aunty and has basically now become the

leader of the wanti there okay got it

just making sure does he's a very

powerful warlord sort of Sultan yeah a

boogeyman okay got it

what if we just stay here then you die

then I'd die no one is dying in the pink

once all be dead cuz we might be there

enough or not enough what is enough dude

they're kind of chatting evylyn whispers

to the snake lady like are these

whose just say who once also have you

met with ander okay

she says lay it on me okay sure okay

sander is the morning Lord in his great

alright strikes when you walk outside

there's like this blast of warm air it

was much more temperate and abiding

where you just came from as you step

back out into the Trop little jumble

your hip tropical jungle you're hit by

the humidity of or illunga as you

remember it and down at the bottom of

the stairs below you you can see dragon

bait and waffles both sort of look up at

you everything is bad and it's also

nighttime it's like you just lost a

whole pile of hours or before I leave I

asked a snake lady like before we go is

that is that little little guy who let

us in here around oh you're talking

about the chewing gus' man yeah the

nature spirits these chewing goes they

are little devils and we go she says

they're all over the jungle you keep

your eye open for them you'll see them

they'll be back they can be very helpful

they live in rocks they live in leaves

they live in water they live in flowers

they live in all the things in the

natural world they are the cutest

elementals I want one all right you just

keep living the dream it's time to leave

alright you withdraw exiting from after

a regaling giving session of all the

information proselytizing about Lysander

she seems very intrigued oh nice she's

interested yep definitely interested in

learning new things about okay

and you leave you step out on to the

ziggurat and you can see there is no

shrine behind you anymore it's just a

flat top ziggurat and it's night has

fallen upon it and the stars you can see

thousands upon thousands of stars in the

sky because there's virtually no ambient

light anywhere so every mill every

galaxy every distant flickering light is

now gazing upon you and you feel like

they are watching you it's so beautiful

we'll just sit down on the ground and

just look at the stars the way they seem

to spiral out it's almost as if you're

almost at the center of it all like the

stars just sort of go off on these

spiraling trails

she said she's watching us from the

stars hi new friend thanks again for

that snaky kissing reel now one of the

stars one of the brightest minds just

sort of winks at you evylyn well do you

uh do you feel like you know or sense

anything now yep Alton you feel like

that you have lived in this jungle in a

previous life and in fact as you look

around or a lunga you can almost see

sort of spectral images of the buildings

as they used to stand before the city

fell to ruin whoa like just ghost

structures all around you you are

definitely in tune with a force not

previously accessible to you I look at D

F and I go yeah and that's where we'll

stop all right
